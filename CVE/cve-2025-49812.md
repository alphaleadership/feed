Description : In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63
an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.

Only configurations using "SSLEngine optional" to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64
which removes support for TLS upgrade.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
