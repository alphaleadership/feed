CVE ID : CVE-2025-38482

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: das6402: Fix bit shift out of bounds

When checking for a supported IRQ number
the following test is used:

	/* IRQs 2
3
5
6
7
10
11
15 are valid for "enhanced" mode */
	if ((1 options[1]) & 0x8cec) {

However
`it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace
so
the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by
requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with
the original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ
will be in the range [1
15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use of
interrupts.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
