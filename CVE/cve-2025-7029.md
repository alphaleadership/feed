Description : A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0xB2) allows a local attacker to control the RBX register
which is used to derive pointers (OcHeader
OcData) passed into power and thermal configuration logic. These buffers are not validated before performing multiple structured memory writes based on OcSetup NVRAM values
enabling arbitrary SMRAM corruption and potential SMM privilege escalation.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
