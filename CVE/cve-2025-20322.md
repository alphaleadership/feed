Description : In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3
9.3.5
9.2.7
and 9.1.10
and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.104
9.3.2408.113
and 9.2.2406.119
an unauthenticated attacker could send a specially-crafted SPL search command that could trigger a rolling restart in the Search Head Cluster through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS).
The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The attacker should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.
See [How rolling restart works](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.2/DistSearch/RestartSHC) for more information.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM
