CVE ID : CVE-2025-24294

Description : The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.

An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet
the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources
as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.

This resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive
resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
