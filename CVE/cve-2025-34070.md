Description : A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service
responsible for integration with GFI AppManager
exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID
which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass
permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
