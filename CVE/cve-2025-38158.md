Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers
we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore
the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem
we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration
if an old magic number is detected
the dma address needs to be
updated.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
