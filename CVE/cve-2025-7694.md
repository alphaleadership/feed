Description : The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the woffice_file_manager_delete() function in all versions up to
and including
5.4.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 6.8 | MEDIUM
