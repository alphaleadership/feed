Description : MaterialX is an open standard for the exchange of rich material and look-development content across applications and renderers. In version 1.39.2
when parsing shader nodes in a MTLX file
the MaterialXCore code accesses a potentially null pointer
which can lead to crashes with maliciously crafted files. An attacker could intentionally crash a target program that uses MaterialX by sending a malicious MTLX file. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
