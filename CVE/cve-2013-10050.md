Description : An OS command injection vulnerability exists in multiple D-Link routers—confirmed on DIR-300 rev A (v1.05) and DIR-615 rev D (v4.13)—via the authenticated tools_vct.xgi CGI endpoint. The web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the pingIp parameter
allowing attackers with valid credentials to inject arbitrary shell commands. Exploitation enables full device compromise
including spawning a telnet daemon and establishing a root shell. The vulnerability is present in firmware versions that expose tools_vct.xgi and use the Mathopd/1.5p6 web server. No vendor patch is available
and affected models are end-of-life.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
