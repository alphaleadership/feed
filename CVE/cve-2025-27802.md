Description : The Episerver Content Management System (CMS) by Optimizely was affected by multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This allowed an authenticated attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

RTE properties (text fields)
which could be used in the "Edit" section of the CMS
allowed the input of arbitrary text. It was possible to input malicious JavaScript 
code in these properties that would be executed if a user visits the previewed 
page. Attackers needed at least the role "WebEditor" in order to exploit this issue.

Affected products: Version 11.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (<11.21.4) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (<11.37.5)
Version 12.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (<12.22.1) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (<11.37.3)

Severity: 4.8 | MEDIUM
