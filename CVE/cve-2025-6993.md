CVE ID : CVE-2025-6993

Published :  July 16

Description : The Ultimate WP Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the get_email_log_details() AJAX handler in versions 1.0.17 to 1.3.6. The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link)
relying only on the ‘edit_posts’ capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to harvest an admin’s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
