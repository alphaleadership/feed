Description : LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/
without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example
via symlink
development misconfiguration
or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
