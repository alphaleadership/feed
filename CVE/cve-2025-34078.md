Description : A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password
an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script
saving the configuration
and triggering it via the API.

This behavior is documented but insecure
as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
