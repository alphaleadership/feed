Description : The target device exposes a service on a specific TCP port with a configured
 endpoint. The access to that endpoint is granted using a Basic Authentication
 method. The endpoint accepts also the PUT method and it is possible to 
write files on the target device file system. Files are written as root.
 Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory Traversal attack 
and write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly to the PUT method
it is possible to leverage the 
same mechanism to read any file from the file system by using the GET 
method.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
