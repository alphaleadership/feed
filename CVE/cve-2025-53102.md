Description : Discourse is an open-source community discussion platform. Prior to version 3.4.7 on the `stable` branch and version 3.5.0.beta.8 on the `tests-passed` branch
upon issuing a physical security key for 2FA
the server generates a WebAuthn challenge
which the client signs. The challenge is not cleared from the user’s session after authentication
potentially allowing reuse and increasing security risk. This is fixed in versions 3.4.7 and 3.5.0.beta.8.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
