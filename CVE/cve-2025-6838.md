Description : The Broken Link Notifier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to
and including
1.3.0 via broken links that are later exported. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files
which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.

Severity: 4.1 | MEDIUM
