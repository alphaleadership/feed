Description : The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the donor notes parameter in all versions up to
and including
4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with GiveWP worker-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally
they need to trick an administrator into visiting the legacy version of the site.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM
