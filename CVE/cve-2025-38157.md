Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled

A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an
ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes
a device-by-zero error in the driver
leading to either a crash or an
out of bounds read.

Prevent this by aborting the handling in ath9k_htc_swba() if beacons are
not enabled.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
