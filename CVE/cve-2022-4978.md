Description : Remote Control Server
maintained by Steppschuh
3.1.1.12 allows unauthenticated remote code execution when authentication is disabled
which is the default configuration. The server exposes a custom UDP-based control protocol that accepts remote keyboard input events without verification. An attacker on the same network can issue a sequence of keystroke commands to launch a system shell and execute arbitrary commands
resulting in full system compromise.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
