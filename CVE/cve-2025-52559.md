Description : Zulip is an open-source team chat application. From versions 2.0.0-rc1 to before 10.4 in Zulip Server
the /digest/ URL of a server shows a preview of what the email weekly digest would contain. This URL
though not the digest itself
contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in both topic names and channel names. This issue has been fixed in Zulip Server 10.4. A workaround for this issue involves denying access to /digest/.

Severity: 6.8 | MEDIUM
