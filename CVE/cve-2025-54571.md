Description : ModSecurity is an open source
cross platform web application firewall (WAF) engine for Apache

an attacker can override the HTTP response’s Content-Type
which could lead to several issues depending on the HTTP scenario. For example
we have demonstrated the potential for XSS and arbitrary script source code disclosure in the latest version of mod_security2. This issue is fixed in version 2.9.12.
