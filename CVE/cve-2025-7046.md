Description : The Portfolio for Elementor & Image Gallery | PowerFolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom JS Attributes of Plugin's widgets in all versions up to
and including
3.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
The issue was partially fixed in version 3.2.0 and fully fixed in version 3.2.1

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM
