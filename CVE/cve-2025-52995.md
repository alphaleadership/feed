Description : File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload
delete
preview
rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10
the implementation of the allowlist is erroneous
allowing a user to execute more shell commands than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands configured
and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the missing separation of scopes on the OS-level
this could give an attacker access to all files managed the application
including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.10.

Severity: 8.0 | HIGH
