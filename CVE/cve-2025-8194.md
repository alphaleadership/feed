CVE ID : CVE-2025-8194

Published :  July 28

Description : There is a defect in the CPython “tarfile” module affecting the “TarFile” extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative offsets without error
resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives. 

This vulnerability can be mitigated by including the following patch after importing the “tarfile” module:



import tarfile

def _block_patched(self
count):
    if count < 0:  # pragma: no cover
        raise tarfile.InvalidHeaderError("invalid offset")
    return _block_patched._orig_block(self
count)

_block_patched._orig_block = tarfile.TarInfo._block
tarfile.TarInfo._block = _block_patched

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
