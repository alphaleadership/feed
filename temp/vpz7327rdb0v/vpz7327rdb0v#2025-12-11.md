var data-var='time'>2101/var> UTC/small>strong>Investigating/strong> - Cloudflare single-file cache purging (purge by URL) called via the Dashboard/API is running up to 30 minutes behind in Eastern North America (ENAM). This also affects the "Always Online" feature.br />br />We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Until then you may use the Purge Everything feature but do be aware it may cause a surge in traffic to your origin server(s). More updates to follow.
