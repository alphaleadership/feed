The root\r\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\r\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\r\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\r\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`\nit dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`\nleading to\r\na kernel OOPS.\r\n\r\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c** Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\r\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\r\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\r\n   `bdev`)\nreturn 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\r\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\r\n\r\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c** Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\r\n   reporting to use a conditional if the manager is used\nreturn the real VRAM\r\n   usage otherwise\nreturn 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\r\n   NULL.\r\n\r\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c** Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\r\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity if the\r\n   manager is usable\ncalculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage otherwise\nset\r\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\r\n\r\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it\r\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs)\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function\n- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized\r\n  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).\r\n\r\nv4 use ttm_resource_manager_used(adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian) | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nserial amba-pl011 avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register\r\n\r\nChapter \"B Generic UART\" in \"ARM Server Base System Architecture\" [1]\r\ndocumentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART\r\ndoes not support DMA. In current code\nsbsa_uart_pops and\r\namba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation\nwhich will invoke\r\npl011_dma_rx_stop\nleading to an access of the DMACR register. This\r\ncommit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the\r\naccess to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.\r\n\r\nWhen the kernel enables DMA engine with \"CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y\"\nLinux\r\nSBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.\r\nFor most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations\nthe DMACR write\r\nbehaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause\r\nobvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware\nlike Xen\r\nvirtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device\nthe behaviour might be different.\r\nXen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest\nwhen guest is\r\naccessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA\r\ncompatible\nit will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA\r\nPL011 driver access DMACR register\nit will get an unhandled data abort\r\nfault and the application will get a segmentation fault\r\nUnhandled fault at 0xffffffc00944d048\r\nMem abort info\r\n  ESR = 0x96000000\r\n  EC = 0x25 DABT (current EL)\nIL = 32 bits\r\n  SET = 0\nFnV = 0\r\n  EA = 0\nS1PTW = 0\r\n  FSC = 0x00 ttbr address size fault\r\nData abort info\r\n  ISV = 0\nISS = 0x00000000\r\n  CM = 0\nWnR = 0\r\nswapper pgtable 4k pages\n39-bit VAs\npgdp=0000000020e2e000\r\n[ffffffc00944d048] pgd=100000003ffff803\np4d=100000003ffff803\npud=100000003ffff803\npmd=100000003fffa803\npte=006800009c090f13\r\nInternal error ttbr address size fault 96000000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\r\n...\r\nCall trace\r\n pl011_stop_rx+0x70/0x80\r\n tty_port_shutdown+0x7c/0xb4\r\n tty_port_close+0x60/0xcc\r\n uart_close+0x34/0x8c\r\n tty_release+0x144/0x4c0\r\n __fput+0x78/0x220\r\n ____fput+0x1c/0x30\r\n task_work_run+0x88/0xc0\r\n do_notify_resume+0x8d0/0x123c\r\n el0_svc+0xa8/0xc0\r\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0xa4/0x130\r\n el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4\r\nCode b9000083 b901f001 794038a0 8b000042 (b9000041)\r\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmedia dvb-usb fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()\r\n\r\nSyzbot reports a memory leak in \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\r\nThe leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's\r\nadapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs\nit will exit before incrementing \"num_adapters_initalized\"\nwhich is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv\r\nin \"dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\". There are multiple error paths that\r\ncan exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the\r\nerror handling paths for \"dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()\"\n\"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()\" and \"dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()\"\r\nwithin \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\r\n\r\nThis means that in case of an error in any of these functions the\r\ncurrent iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's\r\nadap->priv is not freed.\r\n\r\nFix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the\r\n\"stream_init_err\" label in the error path. The rest of the\r\n(accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\r\nas expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.\r\n\r\nSyzbot report\r\n\r\nBUG memory leak\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881172f1a00 (size 512)\r\n  comm \"kworker/02\"\npid 139\njiffies 4294994873 (age 10.960s)\r\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\nbacktrace\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_adapter_init drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c75 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_init drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c184 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_device_init.cold+0x4e5/0x79e drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c308\r\n    [ffffffff830db21d>] dib0700_probe+0x8d/0x1b0 drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_core.c883\r\n    [ffffffff82d3fdc7>] usb_probe_interface+0x177/0x370 drivers/usb/core/driver.c396\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c542 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] really_probe.part.0+0xe7/0x310 drivers/base/dd.c621\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] really_probe drivers/base/dd.c583 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] __driver_probe_device+0x10c/0x1e0 drivers/base/dd.c752\r\n    [ffffffff8274af6a>] driver_probe_device+0x2a/0x120 drivers/base/dd.c782\r\n    [ffffffff8274b786>] __device_attach_driver+0xf6/0x140 drivers/base/dd.c899\r\n    [ffffffff82747c87>] bus_for_each_drv+0xb7/0x100 drivers/base/bus.c427\r\n    [ffffffff8274b352>] __device_attach+0x122/0x260 drivers/base/dd.c970\r\n    [ffffffff827498f6>] bus_probe_device+0xc6/0xe0 drivers/base/bus.c487\r\n    [ffffffff82745cdb>] device_add+0x5fb/0xdf0 drivers/base/core.c3405\r\n    [ffffffff82d3d202>] usb_set_configuration+0x8f2/0xb80 drivers/usb/core/message.c2170\r\n    [ffffffff82d4dbfc>] usb_generic_driver_probe+0x8c/0xc0 drivers/usb/core/generic.c238\r\n    [ffffffff82d3f49c>] usb_probe_device+0x5c/0x140 drivers/usb/core/driver.c293\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c542 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] really_probe.part.0+0xe7/0x310 drivers/base/dd.c621\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] really_probe drivers/base/dd.c583 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] __driver_probe_device+0x10c/0x1e0 drivers/base/dd.c752 | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

When MSR bitmap is updated\nevmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark\r\nthat the msr bitmap was changed.\r\n\r\nvmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr\r\n-> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The\r\nfunction checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is\r\ninsufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this\nthe\r\ncode might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value\r\nleft by another task. Preemption is not disabled\nthe current task can be\r\npreempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple\r\ntimes from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.\r\n\r\nThe manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the\r\nsolution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.\r\n\r\n  BUG kernel NULL pointer dereference\naddress 0000000000000338\r\n  PGD 4e1775067 P4D 0\r\n  Oops 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\r\n  ...\r\n  RIP 0010vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed+0x39/0x50 [kvm_intel]\r\n  ...\r\n  Call Trace\r\n   vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr+0x36/0x260 [kvm_intel]\r\n   vmx_vcpu_create+0xe6/0x540 [kvm_intel]\r\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_create+0x1d1/0x2e0 [kvm]\r\n   kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu+0x178/0x430 [kvm]\r\n   kvm_vm_ioctl+0x53f/0x790 [kvm]\r\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8a/0xc0\r\n   do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x90\r\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

After that\nthe logic attempts to\r\nallocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for\r\neach row. However\ninstead of doing this allocation for each row\r\n(i.e. num_config_bases allocations)\nthe logic erroneously does this\r\nallocation num_config_regs number of times.\r\n\r\nThis scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs\r\nis greater than num_config_bases.

An attacker who already knew or guessed a valid username \r\nand password could submit an arbitrary number of OTP codes without \r\ncausing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert for \r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly \r\nlowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and \r\nincreases the risk of successful account takeover\nespecially if OTP \r\nentropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric codes\nuser reuse\nor predictable\r\n tokens). Additionally\nadministrators had no direct visibility into \r\naccounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures\nmaking targeted attacks \r\nharder to detect and investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts counter on user \r\naccounts\nlocks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions\nresets the \r\ncounter on successful verification\nand surfaces failed 2FA attempts in \r\nthe admin user list. This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP \r\nbrute-force attempts and improves monitoring capabilities for suspicious\r\n 2FA activity.This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup before 2.18.0. | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nbpf Fix reference state management for synchronous callbacks\r\n\r\nCurrently\nverifier verifies callback functions (sync and async) as if\r\nthey will be executed once\n(i.e. it explores execution state as if the\r\nfunction was being called once). The next insn to explore is set to\r\nstart of subprog and the exit from nested frame is handled using\r\ncurframe > 0 and prepare_func_exit. In case of async callback it uses a\r\ncustomized variant of push_stack simulating a kind of branch to set up\r\ncustom state and execution context for the async callback.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach is simple and works when callback really will be\r\nexecuted only once\nit is unsafe for all of our current helpers which\r\nare for_each style\ni.e. they execute the callback multiple times.\r\n\r\nA callback releasing acquired references of the caller may do so\r\nmultiple times\nbut currently verifier sees it as one call inside the\r\nframe\nwhich then returns to caller. Hence\nit thinks it released some\r\nreference that the cb e.g. got access through callback_ctx (register\r\nfilled inside cb from spilled typed register on stack).\r\n\r\nSimilarly\nit may see that an acquire call is unpaired inside the\r\ncallback\nso the caller will copy the reference state of callback and\r\nthen will have to release the register with new ref_obj_ids. But again\nthe callback may execute multiple times\nbut the verifier will only\r\naccount for acquired references for a single symbolic execution of the\r\ncallback\nwhich will cause leaks.\r\n\r\nNote that for async callback case\nthings are different. While currently\r\nwe have bpf_timer_set_callback which only executes it once\neven for\r\nmultiple executions it would be safe\nas reference state is NULL and\r\ncheck_reference_leak would force program to release state before\r\nBPF_EXIT. The state is also unaffected by analysis for the caller frame.\r\nHence async callback is safe.\r\n\r\nSince we want the reference state to be accessible\ne.g. for pointers\r\nloaded from stack through callback_ctx's PTR_TO_STACK\nwe still have to\r\ncopy caller's reference_state to callback's bpf_func_state\nbut we\r\nenforce that whatever references it adds to that reference_state has\r\nbeen released before it hits BPF_EXIT. This requires introducing a new\r\ncallback_ref member in the reference state to distinguish between caller\r\nvs callee references. Hence\ncheck_reference_leak now errors out if it\r\nsees we are in callback_fn and we have not released callback_ref refs.\r\nSince there can be multiple nested callbacks\nlike frame 0 -> cb1 -> cb2\r\netc. we need to also distinguish between whether this particular ref\r\nbelongs to this callback frame or parent\nand only error for our own\nso\r\nwe store state->frameno (which is always non-zero for callbacks).\r\n\r\nIn short\ncallbacks can read parent reference_state\nbut cannot mutate\r\nit\nto be able to use pointers acquired by the caller. They must only\r\nundo their changes (by releasing their own acquired_refs before\r\nBPF_EXIT) on top of caller reference_state before returning (at which\r\npoint the caller and callback state will match anyway\nso no need to\r\ncopy it back to caller). | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmt76 mt7921 don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers\r\n\r\nmt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() and\r\nmt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr()\nboth of which blindly assume that\r\nadequate headroom will be available in the passed skb. This assumption\r\ntypically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for\r\ntransmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an\r\noptimization and is not strictly guaranteed)\nbut the assumption is\r\nsometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of\r\nanother netdev and was passed through to the mt7921\nsuch as by the\r\nbridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to\r\nmt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to\r\nensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be\r\npushed onto the skb.\r\n\r\nWithout this fix\nI can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an\r\nMT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an\r\nIntel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet\r\nadapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard\r\nSMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in\r\nevery system configuration\nas they occur only if the receiving netdev\r\nleaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its\r\nSDIO headers.\r\n\r\nHere is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite\r\n2023-02-21 running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]\r\n\r\n skb_panic from skb_push+0x44/0x48\r\n skb_push from mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb+0xd4/0x190 [mt7921_common]\r\n mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb [mt7921_common] from mt76u_tx_queue_skb+0x94/0x1d0 [mt76_usb]\r\n mt76u_tx_queue_skb [mt76_usb] from __mt76_tx_queue_skb+0x4c/0xc8 [mt76]\r\n __mt76_tx_queue_skb [mt76] from mt76_txq_schedule.part.0+0x13c/0x398 [mt76]\r\n mt76_txq_schedule.part.0 [mt76] from mt76_txq_schedule_all+0x24/0x30 [mt76]\r\n mt76_txq_schedule_all [mt76] from mt7921_tx_worker+0x58/0xf4 [mt7921_common]\r\n mt7921_tx_worker [mt7921_common] from __mt76_worker_fn+0x9c/0xec [mt76]\r\n __mt76_worker_fn [mt76] from kthread+0xbc/0xe0\r\n kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x34\r\n\r\nAfter this fix\nbridging the mt7921 interface works fine on both of my\r\npreviously problematic systems.\r\n\r\n[1] https//github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/5c276f55a4b21345cd4d6200a504ee991851ff7a | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

This was\r\nleading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy\r\nour request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap\r\nwith the missed one.\r\n\r\nTo makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of\r\nthe rbtree\nwe make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly\r\noverlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below\r\nconditions\r\n\r\n  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of\r\n  (ie less than) original logical start.\r\n\r\n  2. It must not be deleted\r\n\r\nTo find this pa we use the following traversal method\r\n\r\n1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring\r\nPA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if\r\nit overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately\r\nadjacent PA.\r\n\r\n2. If the found PA is on right of original goal\nuse rb_prev() to find\r\nthe left adjacent PA.\r\n\r\n3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until\r\na non deleted PA is found.\r\n\r\n4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy\r\nthe original request and proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.\r\n\r\n(While we are at it\nalso fix a possible overflow bug in calculating the\r\nend of a PA)\r\n\r\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/CA+G9fYv2FRpLqBZf34ZinR8bU2_ZRAUOjKAD3+tKRFaEQHtt8Q@mail.gmail.com/ | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use\r\ntest_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged\npage->flags) without inadvertently\r\nsetting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.\r\n\r\nThe above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any\r\ncontrol at the stage 2 mapping\nnor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.\r\nHowever\nthe side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like\r\nswap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A\r\nsubsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination\r\npage even if the tags were owned by KASAN.\r\n\r\nThis issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in\r\ncommit e5b8d9218951 (\"arm64 mte reset the page tag in page->flags\").\r\nWhen this commit was reverted (20794545c146)\nKASAN started reporting\r\naccess faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the\r\noriginal page->flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y)\r\n\r\n  BUG KASAN invalid-access in copy_page+0x10/0xd0 arch/arm64/lib/copy_page.S26\r\n  Read at addr f5ff000017f2e000 by task syz-executor.1/2218\r\n  Pointer tag [f5]\nmemory tag [f2]\r\n\r\nMove the PG_mte_tagged bit setting from mte_sync_tags() to the actual\r\nplace where tags are cleared (mte_sync_page_tags()) or restored\r\n(mte_restore_tags()). | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nbpf\nsockmap Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes\r\n\r\nThere is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced\r\nafter userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt\r\ndropped to zer0 causing use after free.\r\n\r\nThe flow is the following\r\n\r\n  while ((skb = skb_peek(psock->ingress_skb))\r\n    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock\nskb\n...\ningress)\r\n    if (!ingress) ...\r\n    sk_psock_skb_ingress\r\n       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)\r\n          msg->skb = skb\r\n          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock\nmsg)\r\n    skb_dequeue(psock->ingress_skb)\r\n\r\nThe sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is\r\nwhat the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can\r\nread this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook\r\nwill also read msg->skb and then after user space reads the msg will call\r\nconsume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.\r\n\r\nBut\nthe race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to\r\nthe skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the\r\nuser reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.\r\n\r\nThe !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses\r\nsendmsg_*(sk\nmsg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the\r\nstack.\r\n\r\nThe following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen'\r\n\r\n  [ 1022.710250][ T2556] general protection fault\n...\r\n  [...]\r\n  [ 1022.712830][ T2556] Workqueue events sk_psock_backlog\r\n  [ 1022.713262][ T2556] RIP 0010skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\r\n  [ 1022.713653][ T2556] Code ...\r\n  [...]\r\n  [ 1022.720699][ T2556] Call Trace\r\n  [ 1022.720984][ T2556]  TASK>\r\n  [ 1022.721254][ T2556]  ? die_addr+0x32/0x80^M\r\n  [ 1022.721589][ T2556]  ? exc_general_protection+0x25a/0x4b0\r\n  [ 1022.722026][ T2556]  ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x22/0x30\r\n  [ 1022.722489][ T2556]  ? skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\r\n  [ 1022.722854][ T2556]  sk_psock_backlog+0x27a/0x300\r\n  [ 1022.723243][ T2556]  process_one_work+0x2a7/0x5b0\r\n  [ 1022.723633][ T2556]  worker_thread+0x4f/0x3a0\r\n  [ 1022.723998][ T2556]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.724386][ T2556]  kthread+0xfd/0x130\r\n  [ 1022.724709][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.725066][ T2556]  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\r\n  [ 1022.725409][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.725799][ T2556]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\r\n  [ 1022.726201][ T2556]  /TASK>\r\n\r\nTo fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the\r\nengress queue. This bumps the skb->users refcnt so that consume_skb()\r\nand kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can\r\nbe sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just\r\nneed to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which\r\nwe do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBefore locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we\r\ncouldn't race with user and there was no issue here. | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

The caller of\r\nmt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call\r\nmt8186_deinit_clock() but\nbecause of the intervening devm functions\nthe order was wrong.\r\n\r\nSpecifically at probe time\nthe order was\r\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()\r\n2. afe_priv->clk = devm_kcalloc(...)\r\n3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)\r\n\r\nAt remove time\nthe order (which should have been 3\n2\n1) was\r\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()\r\n3.

This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\r\ntarget process.\r\n\r\nDuring exec()\na task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\r\nprivileged one (e.g.\nsetuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\r\nmay change.

An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\r\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\r\nbased on current credentials\nit succeeds.
