Not doing\r\nso would result in applying the mds auth caps of\r\none fs on to the other fs in a multifs ceph cluster.\r\nThe bug causes multiple issues w.r.t user\r\nauthentication\nfollowing is one such example.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (on vstart cluster)\r\n1. Create two file systems in a cluster\nsay 'fsname1' and 'fsname2'\r\n2. Authorize read only permission to the user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname1'\r\n    $ceph fs authorize fsname1 client.usr / r\r\n3.

Update the keyring\r\n    $ceph auth get client.usr >> ./keyring\r\n\r\nWith above permssions for the user 'client.usr'\nfollowing is the\r\nexpectation.\r\n  a. The 'client.usr' should be able to only read the contents\r\n     and not allowed to create or delete files on file system 'fsname1'.\r\n  b. The 'client.usr' should be able to read/write on file system 'fsname2'.\r\n\r\nBut\nwith this bug\nthe 'client.usr' is allowed to read/write on file\r\nsystem 'fsname1'. See below.\r\n\r\n5. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.usr'\r\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph usr@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_usr/\r\n6. Try creating a file on file system 'fsname1' with user 'client.usr'. This\r\n   should fail but passes with this bug.\r\n     $touch /kmnt_fsname1_usr/file1\r\n7. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.admin' and create a\r\n   file.\r\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph admin@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_admin\r\n     $echo \"data\" > /kmnt_fsname1_admin/admin_file1\r\n8. Try removing an existing file on file system 'fsname1' with the user\r\n   'client.usr'. This shoudn't succeed but succeeds with the bug.\r\n     $rm -f /kmnt_fsname1_usr/admin_file1\r\n\r\nFor more information\nplease take a look at the corresponding mds/fuse patch\r\nand tests added by looking into the tracker mentioned below.\r\n\r\nv2 Fix a possible null dereference in doutc\r\nv3 Don't store fsname from mdsmap\nvalidate against\r\n    ceph_mount_options's fsname and use it\r\nv4 Code refactor\nbetter warning message and\r\n    fix possible compiler warning\r\n\r\n[ Slava.Dubeyko \"fsname check failed\" -> \"fsname mismatch\" ] | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nALTCHA is privacy-first software for captcha and bot protection. A cryptographic semantic binding flaw in ALTCHA libraries allows challenge payload splicing\nwhich may enable replay attacks. The HMAC signature does not unambiguously bind challenge parameters to the nonce\nallowing an attacker to reinterpret a valid proof-of-work submission with a modified expiration value. This may allow previously solved challenges to be reused beyond their intended lifetime\ndepending on server-side replay handling and deployment assumptions. The vulnerability primarily impacts abuse-prevention mechanisms such as rate limiting and bot mitigation. It does not directly affect data confidentiality or integrity. This issue has been addressed by enforcing explicit semantic separation between challenge parameters and the nonce during HMAC computation. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions\nwhich include version 1.0.0 of the altcha Golang package\nversion 1.0.0 of the altcha Rubygem\nversion 1.0.0 of the altcha pip package\nversion 1.0.0 of the altcha Erlang package\nversion 1.4.1 of the altcha-lib npm package\nversion 1.3.1 of the altcha-org/altcha Composer package\nand version 1.3.0 of the org.altchaaltcha Maven package. As a mitigation\nimplementations may append a delimiter to the end of the `salt` value prior to HMAC computation (for example\n`salt>?expires=time>`). This prevents ambiguity between parameters and the nonce and is backward-compatible with existing implementations\nas the delimiter is treated as a standard URL parameter separator. | CVSS Score 6.5 (MEDIUM)                                                    \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmedia imon make send_packet() more robust\r\n\r\nsyzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in\r\nhung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].\r\n\r\nFirst problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\r\nafter ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true\nusb_rx_callback_intf0()\r\nresubmits urb after printk()\nand resubmitted urb causes\r\nusb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in\r\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\r\n\r\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\r\n\r\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\r\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\r\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed\nperhaps with a\r\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\r\n  do this they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\r\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers\nbut in\r\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\r\n  with giving up right away.\r\n\r\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever\r\nthis behavior should be fixed.\r\n\r\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\r\nerror code\nthis patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\r\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\r\nir_toy\nmceusb and igorplugusb).\r\n\r\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\r\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true\nusb_rx_callback_intf0() always\r\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon don't wedge\r\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\r\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon don't parse scancodes\r\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet()\nor\r\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\r\nhung task).\r\n\r\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\r\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware the reproducer for this problem sometimes\r\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called)\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\r\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation\nchange send_packet() to\r\nwait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds. | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

However\nthe default CQ creation flow\r\nleaves a valid value in the CQ's arm_db field\nallowing FW to send\r\ninterrupts to polling-only CQs in certain corner cases.\r\n\r\nThese two factors would allow a polling-only kernel CQ to be triggered\r\nby an EQ interrupt and call a completion function intended only for user\r\nCQs\ncausing a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nSome areas in the driver have prevented this issue with one-off fixes\r\nbut did not address the root cause.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the described issue by adding defaults to the create CQ\r\nflow. It adds a default dummy completion function to protect against\r\nnull pointer exceptions\nand it sets an invalid command sequence number\r\nby default in kernel CQs to prevent the FW from sending an interrupt to\r\nthe CQ until it is armed.

This patch prevents\r\nthe BPF subsystem from allowing trampoline attachments to kernel module\r\nfunctions on LoongArch.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary mitigation until the core issues in the trampoline\r\ncode for kernel module handling can be identified and fixed.\r\n\r\n[root@fedora bpf]# ./test_progs -a module_attach -v\r\nbpf_testmod.ko is already unloaded.\r\nLoading bpf_testmod.ko...\r\nSuccessfully loaded bpf_testmod.ko.\r\ntest_module_attachPASSskel_open 0 nsec\r\ntest_module_attachPASSset_attach_target 0 nsec\r\ntest_module_attachPASSset_attach_target_explicit 0 nsec\r\ntest_module_attachPASSskel_load 0 nsec\r\nlibbpf prog 'handle_fentry' failed to attach -ENOTSUPP\r\nlibbpf prog 'handle_fentry' failed to auto-attach -ENOTSUPP\r\ntest_module_attachFAILskel_attach skeleton attach failed -524\r\nSummary 0/0 PASSED\n0 SKIPPED\n1 FAILED\r\nSuccessfully unloaded bpf_testmod.ko.\r\n\r\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/loongarch/CAK3+h2wDmpC-hP4u4pJY8T-yfKyk4yRzpu2LMO+C13FMT58oqQ@mail.gmail.com/\r\n[2] https//lore.kernel.org/loongarch/CAK3+h2wYcpc+OwdLDUBvg2rF9rvvyc5amfHT-KcFaK93uoELPg@mail.gmail.com/ | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nveth more robust handing of race to avoid txq getting stuck\r\n\r\nCommit dc82a33297fc (\"veth apply qdisc backpressure on full ptr_ring to\r\nreduce TX drops\") introduced a race condition that can lead to a permanently\r\nstalled TXQ. This was observed in production on ARM64 systems (Ampere Altra\r\nMax).\r\n\r\nThe race occurs in veth_xmit(). The producer observes a full ptr_ring and\r\nstops the queue (netif_tx_stop_queue()). The subsequent conditional logic\nintended to re-wake the queue if the consumer had just emptied it (if\r\n(__ptr_ring_empty(...)) netif_tx_wake_queue())\ncan fail. This leads to a\r\n\"lost wakeup\" where the TXQ remains stopped (QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF) and\r\ntraffic halts.\r\n\r\nThis failure is caused by an incorrect use of the __ptr_ring_empty() API\r\nfrom the producer side. As noted in kernel comments\nthis check is not\r\nguaranteed to be correct if a consumer is operating on another CPU. The\r\nempty test is based on ptr_ring->consumer_head\nmaking it reliable only for\r\nthe consumer. Using this check from the producer side is fundamentally racy.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the race by adopting the more robust logic from an earlier\r\nversion V4 of the patchset\nwhich always flushed the peer\r\n\r\n(1) In veth_xmit()\nthe racy conditional wake-up logic and its memory barrier\r\nare removed. Instead\nafter stopping the queue\nwe unconditionally call\r\n__veth_xdp_flush(rq). This guarantees that the NAPI consumer is scheduled\nmaking it solely responsible for re-waking the TXQ.\r\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets and completes\r\nNAPI *before* veth_xmit() on the producer side has called netif_tx_stop_queue.\r\nThe __veth_xdp_flush(rq) will observe rx_notify_masked is false and schedule\r\nNAPI.\r\n\r\n(2) On the consumer side\nthe logic for waking the peer TXQ is moved out of\r\nveth_xdp_rcv() and placed at the end of the veth_poll() function. This\r\nplacement is part of fixing the race\nas the netif_tx_queue_stopped() check\r\nmust occur after rx_notify_masked is potentially set to false during NAPI\r\ncompletion.\r\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets\nbut haven't\r\nfinished (rx_notify_masked is still true). The producer veth_xmit() stops the\r\nTXQ and __veth_xdp_flush(rq) will observe rx_notify_masked is true\nmeaning\r\nnot starting NAPI.  Then veth_poll() change rx_notify_masked to false and\r\nstops NAPI.  Before exiting veth_poll() will observe TXQ is stopped and wake\r\nit up. | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

In versions prior to 3.20.1\na Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition allows local attackers to corrupt or truncate arbitrary user files through symlink attacks. The vulnerability exists in both Unix and Windows lock file creation where filelock checks if a file exists before opening it with O_TRUNC. An attacker can create a symlink pointing to a victim file in the time gap between the check and open\ncausing os.open() to follow the symlink and truncate the target file. All users of filelock on Unix\nLinux\nmacOS\nand Windows systems are impacted. The vulnerability cascades to dependent libraries. The attack requires local filesystem access and ability to create symlinks (standard user permissions on Unix Developer Mode on Windows 10+). Exploitation succeeds within 1-3 attempts when lock file paths are predictable. The issue is fixed in version 3.20.1. If immediate upgrade is not possible\nuse SoftFileLock instead of UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock (note different locking semantics\nmay not be suitable for all use cases) ensure lock file directories have restrictive permissions (chmod 0700) to prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks and/or monitor lock file directories for suspicious symlinks before running trusted applications. These workarounds provide only partial mitigation. The race condition remains exploitable. Upgrading to version 3.20.1 is strongly recommended. | CVSS Score 6.3 (MEDIUM)\n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nExpr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.7\nseveral builtin functions in Expr\nincluding `flatten`\n`min`\n`max`\n`mean`\nand `median`\nperform recursive traversal over user-provided data structures without enforcing a maximum recursion depth. If the evaluation environment contains deeply nested or cyclic data structures\nthese functions may recurse indefinitely until exceed the Go runtime stack limit. This results in a stack overflow panic\ncausing the host application to crash. While exploitability depends on whether an attacker can influence or inject cyclic or pathologically deep data into the\nevaluation environment\nthis behavior represents a denial-of-service (DoS) risk and affects overall library robustness. Instead of returning a recoverable evaluation error\nthe process may terminate unexpectedly. In affected versions\nevaluation of expressions that invoke certain builtin functions on untrusted or insufficiently validated data structures can lead to a process-level crash due to stack exhaustion. This issue is most relevant in scenarios where Expr is used to evaluate expressions against externally supplied or dynamically constructed environments cyclic references (directly or indirectly) can be introduced into arrays\nmaps\nor structs and there are no application-level safeguards preventing deeply nested input data. In typical use cases with controlled\nacyclic data\nthe issue may not manifest. However\nwhen present\nthe resulting panic can be used to reliably crash the application\nconstituting a denial of service. The issue has been fixed in the v1.17.7 versions of Expr. The patch introduces a maximum recursion depth limit for affected builtin functions. When this limit is exceeded\nevaluation aborts gracefully and returns a descriptive error instead of panicking. Additionally\nthe maximum depth can be customized by users via `builtin.MaxDepth`\nallowing applications with legitimate deep structures to raise the limit in a controlled manner. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the patched release\nwhich includes both the recursion guard and comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions. For users who cannot immediately upgrade\nsome mitigations are recommended. Ensure that evaluation environments cannot contain cyclic references\nvalidate or sanitize externally supplied data structures before passing them to Expr\nand/or wrap expression evaluation with panic recovery to prevent a full process crash (as a last-resort defensive measure). These workarounds reduce risk but do not fully eliminate the issue without the patch. | CVSS Score 7.5 (HIGH)\n\n",

Starting in version 0.3.0 and prior to version 1.0.0-alpha-1\na nil pointer dereference vulnerability is in the SIPGO library's `NewResponseFromRequest` function that affects all normal SIP operations. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash any SIP application by sending a single malformed SIP request without a To header. The vulnerability occurs when SIP message parsing succeeds for a request missing the To header\nbut the response creation code assumes the To header exists without proper nil checks. This affects routine operations like call setup\nauthentication\nand message handling - not just error cases. This vulnerability affects all SIP applications using the sipgo library\nnot just specific configurations or edge cases\nas long as they make use of the `NewResponseFromRequest` function.

Avoids OOB\naccess in fbcon_remap_all(). Without holding the console lock the call\nraces with switching outputs.\n\nVGA switcheroo calls fbcon_remap_all() when switching clients. The fbcon\nfunction uses struct fb_info.node\nwhich is set by register_framebuffer().\nAs the fb-helper code currently sets up VGA switcheroo before registering\nthe framebuffer\nthe value of node is -1 and therefore not a legal value.\nFor example\nfbcon uses the value within set_con2fb_map() [1] as an index\ninto an array.\n\nMoving vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() after register_framebuffer() can\nresult in VGA switching that does not switch fbcon correctly.\n\nTherefore move vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() under fbcon_fb_registered()\nwhich already holds the console lock. Fbdev calls fbcon_fb_registered()\nfrom within register_framebuffer(). Serializes the helper with VGA\nswitcheroo's call to fbcon_remap_all().\n\nAlthough vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() takes an instance of struct fb_info\nas parameter\nit really only needs the contained fbcon state. Moving the\ncall to fbcon initialization is therefore cleaner than before. Only amdgpu\ni915\nnouveau and radeon support vga_switcheroo.

In the reported\nbug\nthis is triggered by afs_parse_source() parsing the device name given\nto mount() and calling afs_lookup_cell() with the name of the cell.\n\nThe normal key lookup then tries to use the key description on the\nanonymous authentication key as the reference for request_key() - but it\nmay not yet be set and so an oops can happen.\n\nThis has been made more likely to happen by the fix for dynamic lookup\nfailure.\n\nFix this by firstly allocating a reference name and attaching it to the\nafs_cell record when the record is created.  It can share the memory\nallocation with the cell name (unfortunately it can't just overlap the cell\nname by prepending it with \"afs@\" as the cell name already has a '.'\nprepended for other purposes).  This reference name is then passed to\nrequest_key().\n\nSecondly\nthe anon key is now allocated on demand at the point a key is\nrequested in afs_request_key() if it is not already allocated.  A mutex is\nused to prevent multiple allocation for a cell.\n\nThirdly\nmake afs_request_key_rcu() return NULL if the anonymous key isn't\nyet allocated (if we need it) and then the caller can return -ECHILD to\ndrop out of RCU-mode and afs_request_key() can be called.\n\nNote that the anonymous key is kind of necessary to make the key lookup\ncache work as that doesn't currently cache a negative lookup\nbut it's\nprobably worth some investigation to see if NULL can be used instead. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

The update_userdata() function iterates over the\nnt->userdata_group.cg_children list\nand count_extradata_entries() also\niterates over this same list to count nodes.\n\nQuoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst\n> A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer\n> to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'\n> management of the hierarchy\nso configfs uses the subsystem mutex to\n> protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the\n> hierarchy\nit must do so under the protection of the subsystem\n> mutex.\n\nWithout proper locking\nif a userdata item is added or removed\nconcurrently while these functions are iterating\nthe list can be\naccessed in an inconsistent state. For example\nthe list_for_each() loop\ncan reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()\nwhich sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself\nso the loop will\nnever end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).\n\nFix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all\noperations that iterate over cg_children.\nThis includes\n- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over\n  cg_children\n- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call\n  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children\n\nThe su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid\npotential lock ordering issues\nas configfs operations may already hold\nsu_mutex when calling into our code. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

When an administrator saves a user's configuration settings\nthe keys of the `type` POST parameter array are not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows a malicious or compromised administrator account to execute arbitrary SQL commands\nincluding time-based blind SQL injection attacks\nto directly interact with the database. The vulnerability is located in `src/UserEditor.php` within the logic that handles saving user-specific configuration settings. The `type` parameter from the POST request is processed as an array. The code iterates through this array and uses `key($type)` to extract the array key\nwhich is expected to be a numeric ID. This key is then assigned to the `$id` variable. The `$id` variable is subsequently concatenated directly into a `SELECT` and an `UPDATE` SQL query without any sanitization or validation\nmaking it an injection vector. Although the vulnerability requires administrator privileges to exploit\nit allows a malicious or compromised admin account to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can be used to bypass any application-level logging or restrictions\ndirectly manipulate the database\nexfiltrate\nmodify\nor delete all data (including other user credentials\nfinancial records\nand personal information)\nand could potentially lead to further system compromise\nsuch as writing files to the server\ndepending on the database's configuration and user privileges.

A vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 fragmentation reassembly implementation of RIOT OS v2025.07. When copying the contents of the first fragment (offset=0) into the reassembly buffer\nno size check is performed. It is possible to force the creation of a small reassembly buffer by first sending a shorter fragment (also with offset=0). Overflowing the reassembly buffer corrupts the state of other packet buffers which an attacker might be able to used to achieve further memory corruption (potentially resulting in remote code execution). To trigger the vulnerability\nthe `gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag` module must be included and the attacker must be able to send arbitrary IPv6 packets to the victim. Version 2025.10 fixes the issue. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\n[Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2\na Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**\nallowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page\ntheir browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges\nleading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality\nintegrity\nand availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround\nadministrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However\nthis is not recommended without applying the full patch\nas it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues. | CVSS Score 8.8 (HIGH)\n\n",
