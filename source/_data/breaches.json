The root\r\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\r\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\r\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\r\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`\nit dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`\nleading to\r\na kernel OOPS.\r\n\r\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c** Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\r\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\r\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\r\n   `bdev`)\nreturn 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\r\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\r\n\r\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c** Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\r\n   reporting to use a conditional if the manager is used\nreturn the real VRAM\r\n   usage otherwise\nreturn 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\r\n   NULL.\r\n\r\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c** Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\r\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity if the\r\n   manager is usable\ncalculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage otherwise\nset\r\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\r\n\r\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it\r\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs)\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function\n- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized\r\n  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).\r\n\r\nv4 use ttm_resource_manager_used(adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian) | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nserial amba-pl011 avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register\r\n\r\nChapter \"B Generic UART\" in \"ARM Server Base System Architecture\" [1]\r\ndocumentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART\r\ndoes not support DMA. In current code\nsbsa_uart_pops and\r\namba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation\nwhich will invoke\r\npl011_dma_rx_stop\nleading to an access of the DMACR register. This\r\ncommit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the\r\naccess to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.\r\n\r\nWhen the kernel enables DMA engine with \"CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y\"\nLinux\r\nSBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.\r\nFor most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations\nthe DMACR write\r\nbehaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause\r\nobvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware\nlike Xen\r\nvirtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device\nthe behaviour might be different.\r\nXen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest\nwhen guest is\r\naccessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA\r\ncompatible\nit will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA\r\nPL011 driver access DMACR register\nit will get an unhandled data abort\r\nfault and the application will get a segmentation fault\r\nUnhandled fault at 0xffffffc00944d048\r\nMem abort info\r\n  ESR = 0x96000000\r\n  EC = 0x25 DABT (current EL)\nIL = 32 bits\r\n  SET = 0\nFnV = 0\r\n  EA = 0\nS1PTW = 0\r\n  FSC = 0x00 ttbr address size fault\r\nData abort info\r\n  ISV = 0\nISS = 0x00000000\r\n  CM = 0\nWnR = 0\r\nswapper pgtable 4k pages\n39-bit VAs\npgdp=0000000020e2e000\r\n[ffffffc00944d048] pgd=100000003ffff803\np4d=100000003ffff803\npud=100000003ffff803\npmd=100000003fffa803\npte=006800009c090f13\r\nInternal error ttbr address size fault 96000000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\r\n...\r\nCall trace\r\n pl011_stop_rx+0x70/0x80\r\n tty_port_shutdown+0x7c/0xb4\r\n tty_port_close+0x60/0xcc\r\n uart_close+0x34/0x8c\r\n tty_release+0x144/0x4c0\r\n __fput+0x78/0x220\r\n ____fput+0x1c/0x30\r\n task_work_run+0x88/0xc0\r\n do_notify_resume+0x8d0/0x123c\r\n el0_svc+0xa8/0xc0\r\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0xa4/0x130\r\n el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4\r\nCode b9000083 b901f001 794038a0 8b000042 (b9000041)\r\n",

      "Description": "-\n\nIn the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmedia dvb-usb fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()\r\n\r\nSyzbot reports a memory leak in \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\r\nThe leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's\r\nadapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs\nit will exit before incrementing \"num_adapters_initalized\"\nwhich is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv\r\nin \"dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\". There are multiple error paths that\r\ncan exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the\r\nerror handling paths for \"dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()\"\n\"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()\" and \"dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()\"\r\nwithin \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\r\n\r\nThis means that in case of an error in any of these functions the\r\ncurrent iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's\r\nadap->priv is not freed.\r\n\r\nFix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the\r\n\"stream_init_err\" label in the error path. The rest of the\r\n(accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\r\nas expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.\r\n\r\nSyzbot report\r\n\r\nBUG memory leak\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881172f1a00 (size 512)\r\n  comm \"kworker/02\"\npid 139\njiffies 4294994873 (age 10.960s)\r\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\nbacktrace\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_adapter_init drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c75 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_init drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c184 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff844af012>] dvb_usb_device_init.cold+0x4e5/0x79e drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c308\r\n    [ffffffff830db21d>] dib0700_probe+0x8d/0x1b0 drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_core.c883\r\n    [ffffffff82d3fdc7>] usb_probe_interface+0x177/0x370 drivers/usb/core/driver.c396\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c542 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] really_probe.part.0+0xe7/0x310 drivers/base/dd.c621\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] really_probe drivers/base/dd.c583 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] __driver_probe_device+0x10c/0x1e0 drivers/base/dd.c752\r\n    [ffffffff8274af6a>] driver_probe_device+0x2a/0x120 drivers/base/dd.c782\r\n    [ffffffff8274b786>] __device_attach_driver+0xf6/0x140 drivers/base/dd.c899\r\n    [ffffffff82747c87>] bus_for_each_drv+0xb7/0x100 drivers/base/bus.c427\r\n    [ffffffff8274b352>] __device_attach+0x122/0x260 drivers/base/dd.c970\r\n    [ffffffff827498f6>] bus_probe_device+0xc6/0xe0 drivers/base/bus.c487\r\n    [ffffffff82745cdb>] device_add+0x5fb/0xdf0 drivers/base/core.c3405\r\n    [ffffffff82d3d202>] usb_set_configuration+0x8f2/0xb80 drivers/usb/core/message.c2170\r\n    [ffffffff82d4dbfc>] usb_generic_driver_probe+0x8c/0xc0 drivers/usb/core/generic.c238\r\n    [ffffffff82d3f49c>] usb_probe_device+0x5c/0x140 drivers/usb/core/driver.c293\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c542 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ab37>] really_probe.part.0+0xe7/0x310 drivers/base/dd.c621\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] really_probe drivers/base/dd.c583 [inline]\r\n    [ffffffff8274ae6c>] __driver_probe_device+0x10c/0x1e0 drivers/base/dd.c752 | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

When MSR bitmap is updated\nevmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark\r\nthat the msr bitmap was changed.\r\n\r\nvmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr\r\n-> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The\r\nfunction checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is\r\ninsufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this\nthe\r\ncode might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value\r\nleft by another task. Preemption is not disabled\nthe current task can be\r\npreempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple\r\ntimes from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.\r\n\r\nThe manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the\r\nsolution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.\r\n\r\n  BUG kernel NULL pointer dereference\naddress 0000000000000338\r\n  PGD 4e1775067 P4D 0\r\n  Oops 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\r\n  ...\r\n  RIP 0010vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed+0x39/0x50 [kvm_intel]\r\n  ...\r\n  Call Trace\r\n   vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr+0x36/0x260 [kvm_intel]\r\n   vmx_vcpu_create+0xe6/0x540 [kvm_intel]\r\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_create+0x1d1/0x2e0 [kvm]\r\n   kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu+0x178/0x430 [kvm]\r\n   kvm_vm_ioctl+0x53f/0x790 [kvm]\r\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8a/0xc0\r\n   do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x90\r\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",

After that\nthe logic attempts to\r\nallocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for\r\neach row. However\ninstead of doing this allocation for each row\r\n(i.e. num_config_bases allocations)\nthe logic erroneously does this\r\nallocation num_config_regs number of times.\r\n\r\nThis scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs\r\nis greater than num_config_bases.

      "Description": "-\n\nIn affected versions\nvulnerability-lookup did not track or limit failed\r\n One-Time Password (OTP) attempts during Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\r\n verification. An attacker who already knew or guessed a valid username \r\nand password could submit an arbitrary number of OTP codes without \r\ncausing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert for \r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly \r\nlowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and \r\nincreases the risk of successful account takeover\nespecially if OTP \r\nentropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric codes\nuser reuse\nor predictable\r\n tokens). Additionally\nadministrators had no direct visibility into \r\naccounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures\nmaking targeted attacks \r\nharder to detect and investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts counter on user \r\naccounts\nlocks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions\nresets the \r\ncounter on successful verification\nand surfaces failed 2FA attempts in \r\nthe admin user list. This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP \r\nbrute-force attempts and improves monitoring capabilities for suspicious\r\n 2FA activity.This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup before 2.18.0. | Severity UNKNOWN  \n\n",
