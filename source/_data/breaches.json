In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2\nthe simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections\nallowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined\n`server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon\nit logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors\ncausing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication\nno known patched versions are available\nbut a candidate fix is available in pull request 808\nand some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`\nbut resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve\navahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected\nthey use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users. | CVSS Score 5.5 (MEDIUM)\n\n",

Prior to version 15.0.2\nthe OAuth login state tokens are completely stateless and carry no per-request entropy or any data that could link them to the session that initiated the OAuth flow. `generate_state_token()` is always called with an empty `state_data` dict\nso the resulting JWT only contains the fixed audience claim plus an expiration timestamp. On callback\nthe library merely checks that the JWT verifies under `state_secret` and is unexpired there is no attempt to match the state value to the browser that initiated the OAuth request\nno correlation cookie\nand no server-side cache. Any attacker can hit `/authorize`\ncapture the server-generated state\nfinish the upstream OAuth flow with their own provider account\nand then trick a victim into loading `.../callback?code=attacker_code>state=attacker_state>`. Because the state JWT is valid for any client for \\~1 hour\nthe victim’s browser will complete the flow. This leads to login CSRF. Depending on the app’s logic\nthe login CSRF can lead to an account takeover of the victim account or to the victim user getting logged in to the attacker's account. Version 15.0.2 contains a patch for the issue. | CVSS Score 5.9 (MEDIUM)\n\n",

An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance\nincluding unauthorized access to sensitive data\nmodification of workflows\nand execution of system-level operations. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.120.4\n1.121.1\nand 1.122.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version\nwhich introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation. If upgrading is not immediately possible\nadministrators should consider the following temporary mitigations Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures. | CVSS Score 9.9 (CRITICAL)\n\n",

The root cause is\r\nan access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.\r\nSpecifically\nthis happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function\r\nis called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface\nbut the\r\nsg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been\r\nfreed.\r\n\r\nThe SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()\r\nin uas.c\nusing the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.\r\nWithin the uas_submit_urbs() implementation\nthree URBs (sense_urb\ndata_urb\nand cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may\r\noccur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution\nwhich may result\r\nin URB submission failure. However\nsome URBs might have been successfully\r\nsubmitted before the failure\nand uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV\r\nerror code in this case.

When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already\r\nbeen successfully submitted to USB\nit avoids immediately invoking\r\nscsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully\r\nsubmitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set\nthen\r\nthe scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after\r\nall pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise\nthe scsi_done()\r\nfunction will be called within uas_zap_pending()\nwhich is executed after\r\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs().\r\n\r\nThe error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls\r\nuas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case\nthe device is disconnected\nand the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect()\nwhere uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete(). | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\r\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\r\ndriver\nit tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\r\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`\nbut ignores the\r\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\r\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\r\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\r\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\r\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\r\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).

This is happening on copy engine\r\nchannel 3 (CE3) where the driver normally enqueues WMI commands to the\r\nfirmware. Upon receiving a copy complete interrupt\nhost driver will\r\nimmediately unmap and frees the buffer presuming that hardware has\r\nprocessed the buffer. In the issue case\nupon receiving copy complete\r\ninterrupt\nhost driver will unmap and free the buffer but since hardware\r\nis still accessing the buffer (which in this case got unmapped in\r\nparallel)\nSMMU hardware will trigger an SMMU fault resulting in a\r\nkernel panic.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this\nas a work around\nadd a delay before unmapping\r\nthe copy engine source DMA buffer.

Fix\r\nthis by using kernfs_generic_poll function when polling on cgroup-specific\r\npsi triggers. It internally uses kernfs_open_node->poll waitqueue head\r\nwith its lifecycle tied to the file's lifecycle. This also renders the\r\nfix in [1] obsolete\nso revert it.\r\n\r\n[1] commit c2dbe32d5db5 (\"sched/psi Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()\") | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

This could happen if the\r\nrecord was reported to already exist in the\r\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call\nbut then there was an error\r\nlater on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case\nsince\r\nadd_delayed_ref_head() returned an error\nthe caller went to free the\r\nrecord. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer\r\nto NULL\nthen kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object\r\nwhich was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the\r\nobject is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence\nthe\r\nfix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of\r\nthe add_delayed_ref_head(). That is\nwe will never attempt to kfree()\r\nthe given object inside of this function\nand will expect the caller to\r\nact on the 'qrecord' object on its own.

Hence\nthe caller has to kfree the object\r\nonly if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the\r\ntracing logic.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect of the above\nwe must guarantee that\r\n'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the\r\nfunction\nnot at the end\nand then set when an actual insert\r\nhappens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid\r\nvalue on an early exit.\r\n\r\nThe documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated\r\nto reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

This is stemming from a strlen()\r\ncall in hidinput_allocate().\r\n\r\n__compiletime_strlen() is implemented in terms of __builtin_object_size()\nthen does an array access to check for NUL-termination. A quirk of\r\n__builtin_object_size() is that for strings whose values are runtime\r\ndependent\n__builtin_object_size(str\n1 or 0) returns the maximum size\r\nof possible values when those sizes are determinable at compile time.\r\nExample\r\n\r\n  static const char *v = \"FOO BAR\"\r\n  static const char *y = \"FOO BA\"\r\n  unsigned long x (int z) {\r\n      // Returns 8\nwhich is\r\n      // max(__builtin_object_size(v\n1)\n__builtin_object_size(y\n1))\r\n      return __builtin_object_size(z ? v  y\n1)\r\n  }\r\n\r\nSo when FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled\nthe current implementation of\r\n__compiletime_strlen() will try to access beyond the end of y at runtime\r\nusing the size of v. Mixed with UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS we get a fault.\r\n\r\nhidinput_allocate() has a local C string whose value is control flow\r\ndependent on a switch statement\nso __builtin_object_size(str\n1)\r\nevaluates to the maximum string length\nmaking all other cases fault on\r\nthe last character check. hidinput_allocate() could be cleaned up to\r\navoid runtime calls to strlen() since the local variable can only have\r\nliteral values\nso there's no benefit to trying to fortify the strlen\r\ncall site there.\r\n\r\nPerform a __builtin_constant_p() check against index 0 earlier in the\r\nmacro to filter out the control-flow-dependant case. Add a KUnit test\r\nfor checking the expected behavioral characteristics of FORTIFY_SOURCE\r\ninternals. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\n[In the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfs Protect reconfiguration of sb read-write from racing writes\r\n\r\nThe reconfigure / remount code takes a lot of effort to protect\r\nfilesystem's reconfiguration code from racing writes on remounting\r\nread-only. However during remounting read-only filesystem to read-write\r\nmode userspace writes can start immediately once we clear SB_RDONLY\r\nflag. This is inconvenient for example for ext4 because we need to do\r\nsome writes to the filesystem (such as preparation of quota files)\r\nbefore we can take userspace writes so we are clearing SB_RDONLY flag\r\nbefore we are fully ready to accept userpace writes and syzbot has found\r\na way to exploit this [1]. Also as far as I'm reading the code\r\nthe filesystem remount code was protected from racing writes in the\r\nlegacy mount path by the mount's MNT_READONLY flag so this is relatively\r\nnew problem. It is actually fairly easy to protect remount read-write\r\nfrom racing writes using sb->s_readonly_remount flag so let's just do\r\nthat instead of having to workaround these races in the filesystem code.\r\n\r\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/all/00000000000006a0df05f6667499@google.com/T/ | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

The umount performed as a result\r\nof an expire is a umount of a mount that has been automounted\nit's not the\r\nautofs mount itself. They happen independently\nusually after everything\r\nmounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything\r\nhasn't been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts\r\nin place. But expires done in both cases will result in a notification that\r\ncalls autofs_wait_release() with a result status. The problem case is the\r\nsummary execution of of the automount daemon. In this case any waiting\r\nprocesses won't be woken up until either they are terminated or the mount\r\nis umounted.\r\nend edit imk\r\n\r\nSo in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which counter becomes zero.\r\n\r\nedit imk\r\nInitially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release() and\r\nautofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can't be the\r\ncase (obviously) because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the\r\nlist when either of these two functions are called. Consequently the wait\r\nentry will be freed by only one of these functions or by the woken process\r\nin autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls.\r\nend edit imk | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

      "Description": "-\n\n[In the Linux kernel\nthe following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nbtrfs don't free qgroup space unless specified\r\n\r\nBoris noticed in his simple quotas testing that he was getting a leak\r\nwith Sweet Tea's change to subvol create that stopped doing a\r\ntransaction commit.  This was just a side effect of that change.\r\n\r\nIn the delayed inode code we have an optimization that will free extra\r\nreservations if we think we can pack a dir item into an already modified\r\nleaf.  Previously this wouldn't be triggered in the subvolume create\r\ncase because we'd commit the transaction\nit was still possible but\r\nmuch harder to trigger.  It could actually be triggered if we did a\r\nmkdir  subvol create with qgroups enabled.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because in btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index()\nwhich gets\r\ncalled when we're adding the dir item\nwe do the following\r\n\r\n  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info\ntrans->block_rsv\nbytes\nNULL)\r\n\r\nif we're able to skip reserving space.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that trans->block_rsv points at the temporary block\r\nrsv for the subvolume create\nwhich has qgroup reservations in the block\r\nrsv.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because btrfs_block_rsv_release() will do the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n  if (block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved >= block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size) {\r\n\t  qgroup_to_release = block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved -\r\n\t\t  block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size\r\n\t  block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved = block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThe temporary block rsv just has ->qgroup_rsv_reserved set\n->qgroup_rsv_size == 0.  The optimization in\r\nbtrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() sets ->qgroup_rsv_reserved = 0.  Then\r\nlater on when we call btrfs_subvolume_release_metadata() which has\r\n\r\n  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info\nrsv\n(u64)-1\nqgroup_to_release)\r\n  btrfs_qgroup_convert_reserved_meta(root\nqgroup_to_release)\r\n\r\nqgroup_to_release is set to 0\nand we do not convert the reserved\r\nmetadata space.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the block rsv code has been unconditionally\r\nmessing with ->qgroup_rsv_reserved\nbecause the main place this is used\r\nis delalloc\nand any time we call btrfs_block_rsv_release() we do it\r\nwith qgroup_to_release set\nand thus do the proper accounting.\r\n\r\nThe subvolume code is the only other code that uses the qgroup\r\nreservation stuff\nbut it's intermingled with the above optimization\nand thus was getting its reservation freed out from underneath it and\r\nthus leaking the reserved space.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to simply not mess with the qgroup reservations if we\r\ndon't have qgroup_to_release set.  This works with the existing code as\r\nanything that messes with the delalloc reservations always have\r\nqgroup_to_release set.  This fixes the leak that Boris was observing. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",

This could lead to\r\ninconsistent access results\npotential access right widening\nand\r\nhard-to-debug renames\nespecially since such paths cannot be printed.\r\n\r\nFor a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory\nit needs to\r\nhave write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG\nFS_REMOVE_FILE\nand FS_REFER) to\r\nthe underlying source of the bind mount\nand read access to the related\r\nmount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access\r\nrights than those defined by its Landlock domain\nthis could lead to\r\ninconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be\r\ninherited from the mount point hierarchy\nwhile inheriting permissions\r\nfrom the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.\r\n\r\nLandlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected\r\ndirectories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the\r\nmount point is not found in the hierarchy walk\nand also always taking\r\ninto account the mount point from which these disconnected directories\r\nwere opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would\r\nwiden access rights [1].\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that\neven if disconnected hierarchies might not be\r\nvisible or accessible to a sandboxed task\nrelying on the collected\r\naccess rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will\r\nnot be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison\r\nbetween the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).\r\nIt may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and\r\ndirectories\nbut the security policies are always enforced for all the\r\nevaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to\r\nusers and safer from an access control perspective.\r\n\r\nRemove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and\r\nfix the related comment.\r\n\r\nBecause opened files have their access rights stored in the related file\r\nsecurity properties\nthere is no impact for disconnected or unlinked\r\nfiles. | Severity UNKNOWN\n\n",
