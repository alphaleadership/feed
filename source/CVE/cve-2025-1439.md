Description : The Advanced iFrame [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to Stored [[Cross-Site Scripting]] via the [[plugin]]'s 'advanced_iframe' shortcode in all versions up to
and including
2024.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes through the 'src' attribute when the src supplied returns a header with an injected value . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary [[Web]] scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM
