Description : A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0
specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication
potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality
integrity
and availability.

Severity: 5.0 | MEDIUM
