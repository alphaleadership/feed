Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

In a few places where we call read_one_inode()
if we get a NULL pointer
we end up jumping into an error path
or fallthrough in case of
__add_inode_ref()
where we then do something like this:

   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);

which results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory
access
resulting in a crash.

Fix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
