Description : A Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability in kernel filter processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] sending IPv6 traffic to an interface to effectively bypass any firewall filtering configured on the interface.

Due to an issue with Junos OS kernel filter processing
the 'payload-protocol' match is not being supported
causing any term containing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. In essence
these firewall filter terms were being processed as an 'accept' for all traffic on the interface.

This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S11
*  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S7
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5
*  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1
*  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S2
24.4R2.
