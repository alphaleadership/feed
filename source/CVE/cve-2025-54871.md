Description : Electron Capture facilitates video playback for screen-sharing and capture. In versions 2.19.1 and below
the elecap app on  [[ [[ [[ [[macOS]]]]]]]] allows local unprivileged users to bypass  [[ [[ [[ [[macOS]]]]]]]] TCC privacy protections by enabling ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE. This environment variable allows arbitrary Node.js code to be executed via the -e flag
which runs inside the main Electron context
inheriting any previously granted TCC entitlements (such as access to Documents
Downloads
etc.). This issue is fixed in version 2.20.0.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM
