Description : Exporting a TPM based RSA key larger than 2048 bits from the TPM could overrun a stack buffer if the default `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS=2048` is used. If your TPM 2.0 module supports RSA key sizes larger than 2048 bit and your applications supports creating or importing an RSA private or public key larger than 2048 bits and your application calls `wolfTPM2_RsaKey_TpmToWolf` on that key
then a stack buffer could be overrun. If the `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS` build-time macro is set correctly (RSA bits match what TPM hardware is capable of) for the hardware target
then a stack overrun is not possible.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
