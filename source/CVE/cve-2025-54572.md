Description : The Ruby  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[SAML]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] library is for implementing the client side of a  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[SAML]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] authorization. In versions 1.18.0 and below
a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in ruby-saml even with the message_max_bytesize setting configured. The vulnerability occurs because the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[SAML]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] response is validated for Base64 format prior to checking the message size
leading to potential resource exhaustion. This is fixed in version 1.18.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
