Description : A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed [[attacker]]s to execute arbitrary code by [[exploit]]ing the pre-receive hook functionality
potentially leading to privilege escalation and system [[compromise]]. The vulnerability involves using dynamically allocated ports that become temporarily available
such as during a hot patch upgrade. This means the vulnerability is only [[exploit]]able during specific operational conditions
which limits the attack window. Exploitation required either site [[admin]]istrator [[permission]]s to enable and configure pre-receive hooks or a user with [[permission]]s to modify repositories containing pre-receive hooks where this functionality was already enabled. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.17 and was fixed in versions 3.16.2
3.15.6
3.14.11
3.13.14. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
