Description : A flaw was found in Keycloak. When the configuration uses [[JWT]] [[token]]s for authentication
the [[token]]s are cached until expiration. If a client uses [[JWT]] [[token]]s with an excessively long expiration time
for example
24 or 48 hours
the cache can grow indefinitely
leading to an OutOfMemoryError. This issue could result in a denial of service condition
preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.

Severity: 4.9 | MEDIUM
