Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version

The strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it
thinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target
buffer size is passed in.

Anyway
instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat()
just use
memcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.

BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a
properly terminated string.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
