Description : Icinga [[Web]] 2 is an open source monitoring [[Web]] interface
framework and command-line interface. A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.11.5 and 2.12.13 allows an attacker to craft a request that
once transmitted to a victim's Icinga [[Web]]
allows to embed arbitrary Javascript into it and to act on behalf of that user. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.11.5 and 2.12.3 of Icinga [[Web]] 2. As a workaround
those who have Icinga [[Web]] 2.12.2 may enable a content security policy in the application settings. Any modern browser with a working CORS implementation also sufficiently guards against the vulnerability.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
