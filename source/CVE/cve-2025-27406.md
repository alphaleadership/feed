Description : Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the monitoring [[Web]] frontend and framework Icinga [[Web]] 2. A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the [[attacker]] to act on behalf of the user
if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser
if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround
review all templates and remove suspicious settings.

Severity: 7.6 | HIGH
