Description : The Advanced [[Go]]ogle reCAPTCHA [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to generic [[SQL]] Injection via the ‘sSearch’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
1.29 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to append additional [[SQL]] queries into already existing queries
particularly when the [[plugin]]’s settings page hasn’t been visited and its welcome message has not been dismissed. This issue can be used to extract [[sensitive]] information from the database.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
