Description : node-code-sandbox-mcp is a Node.js–based Model Context Protocol server that spins up disposable Docker containers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Prior to 1.3.0
a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync
enabling an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges on the host machine
bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
