Description : DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu
a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29
the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability
because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory
resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
