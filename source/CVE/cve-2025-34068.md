Description : An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Samsung WLAN AP WEA453e firmware prior to version 5.2.4.T1 via improper input validation in the “Tech Support” diagnostic functionality. The command1 and command2 POST or GET parameters accept arbitrary shell commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a request that injects shell commands to create output files in writable directories and then access their contents via the download endpoint. This flaw allows complete compromise of the device without authentication.
