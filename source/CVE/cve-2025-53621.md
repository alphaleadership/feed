Description : DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. Two related XML External Entity (XXE) injection possibilities impact all versions of DSpace prior to 7.6.4
8.2
and 9.1. External entities are not disabled when parsing XML files during import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format)
either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. External entities are also not explicitly disabled when parsing XML responses from some upstream services (ArXiv
Crossref
OpenAIRE
Creative Commons) used in import from external sources via the user interface or REST API. An XXE injection in these files may result in a connection being made to an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]'s site or a local path readable by the Tomcat user
with content potentially being injected into a metadata field. In the latter case
this may result in sensitive content disclosure
including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore
to exploit this vulnerability
the malicious payload would have to be provided by an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] and trusted by an administrator
who would trigger the import. The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4
8.2
and 9.1. Please upgrade to one of these versions. For those who cannot upgrade immediately
it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. One may also apply some best practices
though the protection provided is not as complete as upgrading. Administrators must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing. As necessary
affected external services can be disabled to mitigate the ability for payloads to be delivered via external service APIs.

Severity: 6.9 | MEDIUM
