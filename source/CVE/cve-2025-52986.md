Description : A  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[Missing]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local
low privileged user to cause an impact to the availability of the device.

When RIB sharding is enabled and a user executes one of several routing related 'show' commands
a certain amount of memory is leaked. When all available memory has been consumed rpd will crash and restart.

The leak can be monitored with the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[CLI]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] command:



show task memory detail | match task_shard_mgmt_cookie



where the allocated memory in bytes can be seen to continuously increase with each  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[exploit]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]ation.
