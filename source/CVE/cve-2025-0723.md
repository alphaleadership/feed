Description : The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles
Groups and Communities [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to blind and time-based [[SQL]] Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to
and including
5.9.4.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to append additional [[SQL]] queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract [[sensitive]] information from the database.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
