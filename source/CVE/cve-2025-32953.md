Description : z80pack is a mature emulator of multiple platforms with 8080 and Z80 CPU. In version 1.38 and prior
the `makefile-ubuntu.yml` workflow [[file]] uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the `z80pack-ubuntu` artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory
which includes the automatically generated `.git/config` [[file]] containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow
there is a few seconds where an [[attacker]] can extract the [[token]] from the artifact and use it with the Github [[API]] to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. This issue has been fixed in commit bd95916.

Severity: 8.7 | HIGH
