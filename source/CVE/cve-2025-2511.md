Description : The AHAthat [[plugin]] [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to time-based [[SQL]] Injection via the 'id' parameter in all versions up to
and including
1.6 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query.  This makes it possible for authenticated [[attacker]]s
