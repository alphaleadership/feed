Description : The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to [[PHP]] Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
1.3.8.7 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload'
 function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a [[PHP]] Object through a PHAR [[file]]. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software
which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another [[plugin]] or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional [[plugin]] or theme installed on the target system
it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary [[file]]s
retrieve [[sensitive]] data
or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be [[exploit]]ed by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the [[file]] upload action. The Flamingo [[plugin]] must be installed and activated in order to [[exploit]] the vulnerability.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
