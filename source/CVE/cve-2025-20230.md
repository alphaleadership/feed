Description : In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.1
9.3.3
9.2.5
and 9.1.8
and versions below 3.8.38 and 3.7.23 of the Splunk Secure [[Gateway]] app on Splunk Cloud Platform
a LOW-privileged user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could edit and delete other user data in App Key Value Store (KVStore) collections that the Splunk Secure [[Gateway]] app created. This is due to [[missing]] access control and incorrect ownership of the data in those KVStore collections.
In the affected versions
the `nobody` user owned the data in the KVStore collections. This meant that there was no specific owner assigned to the data in those collections.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM
