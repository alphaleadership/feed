Description : The Nginx Cache Purge Preload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to
and including
2.1.1 via the 'nppp_preload_cache_on_update' function. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERERER'] parameter passed from the 'nppp_handle_fastcgi_cache_actions_admin_bar' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to execute code on the server.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH
