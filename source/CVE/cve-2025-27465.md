CVE ID : CVE-2025-27465

Published :  July 16

Description : Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it
using an executable
stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception
which is supposed to be
handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.

For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used
the
metadata for exception handling was incorrect
preventing Xen from
handling the the exception gracefully
treating it as fatal instead.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
