Description : The WordPress Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
0.8.3 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'maybe_unserialize' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software
which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system
it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files
retrieve sensitive data
or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH
