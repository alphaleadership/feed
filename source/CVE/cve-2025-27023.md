Description : Lack or insufficent input validation in WebGUI CLI web in Infinera G42 
version R6.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to read all OS files 
via crafted CLI commands.


Details: The web interface based management of the Infinera G42 appliance enables the feature of
 executing a restricted set of commands. This feature 
also offers the option to execute a script-file already present on the target
 device. When a non-script or incorrect file is specified
the content 
of the file is shown along with an error message. Due to an execution of the http service with a privileged user all files on the file system can be viewed this way.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
