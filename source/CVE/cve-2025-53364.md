Description : Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2
the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data
this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
