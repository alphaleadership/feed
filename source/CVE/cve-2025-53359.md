Description : ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0
signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions
but not for EIP-2930
EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate
however upgrading is recommended.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
