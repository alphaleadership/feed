Description : Catalyst::Plugin::Session before version 0.44 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.

The session id is generated from a (usually SHA-1) hash of a simple counter
the epoch time
the built-in rand function
the PID and the current Catalyst context. This information is of low entropy. The PID will come from a small set of numbers
and the epoch time may be guessed
if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

Predicable session ids could allow an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to gain access to systems.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
