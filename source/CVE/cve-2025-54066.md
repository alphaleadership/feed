Description : DiracX-Web is a web application that provides an interface to interact with the DiracX services. Prior to version 0.1.0-a8
an attacker can forge a request that they can pass to redirect an authenticated user to another arbitrary website. In the login page
DiracX-Web has a `redirect` field which is the location where the server will redirect the user. This URI is not verified
and can be an arbitrary URI. Paired with a parameter pollution
an attacker can hide their malicious URI. This could be used for phishing
and extract new data (such as redirecting to a new "log in" page
and asking another time credentials). Version 0.1.0-a8 fixes this vulnerability.

Severity: 4.7 | MEDIUM
