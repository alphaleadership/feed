Description : YesWiki is a wiki system written in [[PHP]]. Prior to version 4.5.4
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript [[payload]]s that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The [[XSS]] occurs because the application [[fail]]s to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably
the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `` tags
but does not account for [[payload]]s obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
