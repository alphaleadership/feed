Description : A path traversal vulnerability exists in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.27 through 0.12.40

including sensitive system files. The issue arises due to improper validation or sanitization of the file path
enabling path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.12.41.
