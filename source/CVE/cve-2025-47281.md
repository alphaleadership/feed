Description : Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below
a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g.
). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions
specifically getValueAsStringMap
which expect string values
results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil
not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.

Severity: 7.7 | HIGH
