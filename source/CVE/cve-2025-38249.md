Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()
the length value returned from
snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length
this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
