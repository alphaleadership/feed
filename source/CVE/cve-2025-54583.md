Description : GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint (e.g.
github.com). Versions 1.19.1 and below allow users to push to remote repositories while bypassing policies and explicit approvals. Since checks and  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]s are skipped
code containing secrets or unwanted changes could be pushed into a repository. This is fixed in version 1.19.2.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
