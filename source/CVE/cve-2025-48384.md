CVE ID : CVE-2025-48384

Description : Git is a fast
scalable
distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value
Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry
values with a trailing CR are not quoted
causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule
if the submodule path contains a trailing CR
the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory
and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook
the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7
v2.44.4
v2.45.4
v2.46.4
v2.47.3
v2.48.2
v2.49.1
and v2.50.1.

Severity: 8.0 | HIGH
