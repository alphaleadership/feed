Description : Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510
the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that
when visited by an authenticated user
can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically
since the application does OS command execution by design
this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature
enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.

Severity: 9.6 | CRITICAL
