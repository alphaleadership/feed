Description : HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.8 and below
the HAX CMS NodeJS application crashes when an authenticated  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] provides an API request lacking required URL parameters. This vulnerability affects the listFiles and saveFiles endpoints. This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly handle exceptions which occur as a result of changes to user-modifiable URL parameters. This is fixed in version 11.0.9.
