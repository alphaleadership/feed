Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init

When two instances of uart devices are probing
a concurrency race can
occur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function
which first
allocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver
structure
the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and
call ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port
which expects the uart
driver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a
null pointer dereference:

[    8.143581] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference

To prevent it
move uart driver registration in to init function. This
will ensure that uart_driver is always registered when probe function
is called.
