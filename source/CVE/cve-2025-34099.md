Description : An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in VICIdial versions 2.9 RC1 through 2.13 RC1
within the vicidial_sales_viewer.php component when password encryption is enabled (a non-default configuration).

This allows remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user.
