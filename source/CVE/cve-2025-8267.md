Description : Versions of the package ssrfcheck before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to an incomplete denylist of IP address ranges. Specifically
the package fails to classify the reserved IP address space 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast) as invalid. This oversight allows  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to craft requests targeting these multicast addresses.
