Description : Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a player. The HTTP Gateway processes headers
but with no timeout set. With a slow loris attack
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] could cause Denial of Service (DoS). Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization
so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities
so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 1385bd8 and shipped in v0.1.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
