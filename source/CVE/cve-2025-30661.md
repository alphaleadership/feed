Description : An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in line card script processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local
low-privileged user to install scripts to be executed as root
leading to privilege escalation.

A local user with access to the local file system can copy a script to the router in a way that will be executed as root
as the system boots. Execution of the script as root can lead to privilege escalation
potentially providing the adversary complete control of the system.

This issue only affects specific line cards
such as the MPC10
MPC11
LC4800
LC9600
MX304-LMIC16
SRX4700
and EX9200-15C.

*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5
*  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1
