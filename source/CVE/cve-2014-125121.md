Description : Array Networks vAPV (version 8.3.2.17) and vxAG (version 9.2.0.34) appliances are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by a combination of hardcoded SSH credentials (or SSH private key) and insecure permissions on a startup script. The devices ship with a default SSH login or a hardcoded DSA private key
allowing an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to authenticate remotely with limited privileges.


Once authenticated
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can overwrite the world-writable /ca/bin/monitor.sh script with arbitrary commands. Since this script is executed with elevated privileges through the backend binary
enabling the debug monitor via backend -c "debug monitor on" triggers execution of the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]'s payload as root. This allows full system compromise.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
