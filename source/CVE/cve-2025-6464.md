Description : The Forminator Forms – Contact Form
Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
1.44.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software
which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system
it may allow the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to perform actions like delete arbitrary files
retrieve sensitive data
or execute code depending on the POP chain present. Deserialization occurs when the form submission is deleted
whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
