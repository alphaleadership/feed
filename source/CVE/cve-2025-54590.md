Description : webfinger.js is a TypeScript-based  [[ [[ [[ [[Web]]]]]]]]Finger client that runs in both browsers and Node.js environments. In versions 2.8.0 and below
the lookup function accepts user addresses for account checking. However
the ActivityPub specification requires preventing access to localhost services in production. This library does not prevent localhost access
only checking for hosts that start with "localhost" and end with a port. Users can  [[ [[ [[ [[exploit]]]]]]]] this by creating servers that send GET requests with controlled host
path
and port parameters to query services on the instance's host or local network
enabling blind  [[ [[ [[ [[SSRF]]]]]]]]  [[ [[ [[ [[attacks]]]]]]]]. This is fixed in version 2.8.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
