Description : Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions below 1.3.9
If the file is a dotfile
editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence
if sensitive MCP files
such as the .cursor/mcp.json file don't already exist in the workspace
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.

Severity: 8.5 | HIGH
