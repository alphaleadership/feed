Description : The Avatar [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to arbitrary [[file]] deletion due to insufficient [[file]] path validation in a function in all versions up to
and including
0.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to delete arbitrary [[file]]s on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right [[file]] is deleted (such as [[wp]]-config.php).

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
