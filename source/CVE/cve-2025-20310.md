Description : A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated
remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive
browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] would need valid agent credentials.
