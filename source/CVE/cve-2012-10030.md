Description : FreeFloat FTP Server contains multiple critical design flaws that allow unauthenticated remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to upload arbitrary files to sensitive system directories. The server accepts empty credentials
defaults user access to the root of the C:\ drive
and imposes no restrictions on file type or destination path. These conditions enable  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to upload executable payloads and .mof files to locations such as system32 and wbem\mof
where Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) automatically processes and executes them. This results in remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges
without requiring user interaction.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
