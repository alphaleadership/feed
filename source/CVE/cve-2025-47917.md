Description : Mbed  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[TLS]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however
the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument
which performs a deep free(). As a result
application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed
resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular
the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).

Severity: 8.9 | HIGH
