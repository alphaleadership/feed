Description : An authenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists in various D-Link routers (tested on DIR-615H1 running firmware version 8.04) via the tools_vct.htm endpoint. The web interface fails to sanitize input passed from the ping_ipaddr parameter to the tools_vct.htm diagnostic interface
allowing  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to inject arbitrary shell commands using backtick encapsulation. With default credentials
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can exploit this blind injection vector to execute arbitrary commands.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
