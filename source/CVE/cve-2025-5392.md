Description : The GB Forms DB plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to
and including
1.0.2 via the gbfdb_talk_to_front() function. This is due to the function accepting user input and then passing that through call_user_func(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to execute code on the server which can be leverage to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts to name a few things.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
