Description : Icinga DB Web provides a graphical interface for Icinga monitoring. Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.2.2
users with access to Icinga Dependency Views
are allowed to see hosts and services that they weren't meant to on the dependency map. However
the name of an object will not be revealed nor does this grant access to a host's or service's detail view. Please note that this only affects the restrictions `filter/hosts` and `filter/services`. `filter/objects` is not affected by this and restricts objects as it is supposed to. Version 1.2.2 applies these restrictions properly. As a workaround
one may downgrade to version 1.1.3.

Severity: 2.4 | LOW
