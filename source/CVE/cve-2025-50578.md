Description : LinuxServer.io heimdall 2.6.3-ls307 contains a vulnerability in how it handles user-supplied HTTP headers
specifically `X-Forwarded-Host` and `Referer`. An unauthenticated remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can manipulate these headers to perform Host Header Injection and Open Redirect attacks. This allows the loading of external resources from  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]-controlled domains and unintended redirection of users
potentially enabling phishing
UI redress
and session theft. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation and trust of untrusted input
affecting the integrity and trustworthiness of the application.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
