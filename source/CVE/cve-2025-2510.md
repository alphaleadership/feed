Description : The Frndzk Expandable Bottom Bar [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'text' parameter in all versions up to
and including
1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with [[admin]]istrator-level permissions and above
to inject arbitrary [[Web]] scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM
