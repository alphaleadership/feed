Description : The Email Notifications for Updates [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a [[missing]] capability check on the awun_import_settings() function in all versions up to
and including
1.1.6. This makes it possible for authenticated [[attacker]]s
with Subscriber-level access and above
to update arbitrary options on the [[WordPress]] site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to [[admin]]istrator and enable user registration for [[attacker]]s to gain [[admin]]istrative user access to a vulnerable site.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
