Description : The widely used component that establishes outbound  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[TLS]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] connections in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java does not reliably match the hostname that is used for the connection against the wildcard hostname defined in the received certificate of remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[TLS]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] server. This might lead to the outbound connection being established to a possibly malicious remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[TLS]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] server and hence disclose information. Integrity and Availability are not impacted.

Severity: 3.5 | LOW
