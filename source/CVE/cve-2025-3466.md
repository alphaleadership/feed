Description : langgenius/dify versions 1.1.0 to 1.1.2 are vulnerable to unsanitized input in the code node
allowing execution of arbitrary code with full root permissions. The vulnerability arises from the ability to override global functions in JavaScript
such as parseInt
before sandbox security restrictions are imposed. This can lead to unauthorized access to secret keys
internal network servers
and lateral movement within dify.ai. The issue is resolved in version 1.1.3.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
