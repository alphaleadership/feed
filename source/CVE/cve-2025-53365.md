Description : The MCP Python SDK
called `mcp` on PyPI
is a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Prior to version 1.10.0
if a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session
this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side
causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions
and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures. Version 1.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.
