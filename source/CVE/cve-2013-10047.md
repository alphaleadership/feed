Description : An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in MiniWeb HTTP Server <= Build 300 that allows unauthenticated remote  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to upload arbitrary files to the server’s filesystem. By abusing the upload handler and crafting a traversal path
an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can place a malicious .exe in system32
followed by a .mof file in the WMI directory. This triggers execution of the payload with SYSTEM privileges via the Windows Management Instrumentation service. The exploit is only viable on Windows versions prior to Vista.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
