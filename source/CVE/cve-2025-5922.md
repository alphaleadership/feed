Description : Access to TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool is restricted to  [[ [[ [[ [[admin]]]]]]]]istrators (unless "Disable UAC" option is enabled) and requires a PIN code. In versions below v18.40.6.17 the PIN's hash is stored in a system registry accessible to regular users
making it possible to perform a brute-force attack using rainbow tables
since the hash is not salted.
LTS (Long-Term Support) versions also received  [[ [[ [[ [[patches]]]]]]]] in v17.2025.6.27 and v16.2025.6.27 releases.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
