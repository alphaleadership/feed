Description : [[Applio]] is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) in restart.py. `model_name` in train.py takes user input
and passes it to the `stop_train` function in restart.py
which uses it construct a path to a folder with `config.json`. That `config.json` is opened and the list of values under "process_pids" are read. Next all the process IDs listed in the JSON are killed. Using one of the arbitrary [[file]] writes
one can  write to `logs/foobar` a `config.json` [[file]]
which contains a list of process IDs. Then one can access this endpoint to kill these processes. Since an [[attacker]] can't know what process is running on which process ID
they can send a list of hundreds of process IDs
which can kill the process that applio is using to run
as well as other
potentially important processes
which leads to[[DoS]]. Note that constructing a path with user input also enables path traversal. For example
by supplying "../../" in `model_name` one can access `config.json` freom locations two folders down on the server. As of time of publication
no known [[patches]] are available.
