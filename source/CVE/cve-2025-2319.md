Description : The EZ [[SQL]] Reports Shortcode Widget and DB Backup [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to [[Cross-Site Request Forgery]] in versions 4.11.13 to 5.25.08. This is due to [[missing]] or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ELI[[SQL]]REPORTS_menu' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated [[attacker]]s to execute code on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site [[admin]]istrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Version 5.25.10 adds a nonce check
which makes this vulnerability [[exploit]]able by [[admin]]s only.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
