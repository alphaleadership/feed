Description : Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. In versions 0.2.0 and below
a critical Remote Code Execution ( [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[RCE]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled
the package exposes a local development  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[HTTP]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] server with an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[missing]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] cross-origin protections
any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[HTTP]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints
/inspector/graph/interact
accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
