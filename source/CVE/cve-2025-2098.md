Description : Fast CAD Reader application on [[macOS]] was found to be installed with incorrect [[file]] [[permission]]s (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard [[macOS]] security practices
where applications should have drwxr-xr-x [[permission]]s. Incorrect [[permission]]s allow for Dylib Hijacking. Guest account
other users and applications can [[exploit]] this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects Fast CAD Reader in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5

Severity: 0.0 | NA
