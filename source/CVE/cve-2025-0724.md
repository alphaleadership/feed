Description : The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles
Groups and Communities [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to [[PHP]] Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
5.9.4.5 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_user_meta_fields_html function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to inject a [[PHP]] Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software
which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another [[plugin]] or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional [[plugin]] or theme installed on the target system
it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files
retrieve [[sensitive]] data
or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
