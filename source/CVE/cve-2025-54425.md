Description : Umbraco is an ASP.NET CMS. In versions 13.0.0 through 13.9.2
15.0.0 through 15.4.1 and 16.0.0 through 16.1.0
the content delivery  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] can be restricted from public access where an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] key must be provided in a header to authorize the request. It's also possible to configure output caching
such that the delivery  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] outputs will be cached for a period of time
improving performance. There's an issue when these two things are used together
where caching doesn't vary by the header that contains the  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] key. As such
it's possible for a user without a valid  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[API]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] key to retrieve a response for a given path and query if it has recently been requested and cached by request with a valid key. This is fixed in versions 13.9.3
15.4.4 and 16.1.1.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
