Description : The Attachment Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the handle_actions() function in all versions up to
and including
2.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL
