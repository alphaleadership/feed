Description : Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However
starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.14.5
10.0.8
and 11.1.0
this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads
such as
if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html. This may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability
even when using escapeParameterHtml: true
if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html. Versions 9.14.5
10.0.8
and 11.1.0 contain a fix for the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
