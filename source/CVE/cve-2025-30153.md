Description : kin-openapi is a [[Go]] project for handling OpenAPI [[file]]s. Prior to 0.131.0
when validating a request with a multipart/form-data schema
if the OpenAPI schema allows it
an attacker can upload a [[crafted]] ZIP [[file]] (e.g.
a ZIP bomb)
causing the server to consume all available system memory. The root cause comes from the ZipFileBodyDecoder
which is registered automatically by the module (contrary to what the documentation says). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.131.0.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
