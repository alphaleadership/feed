Description : The Forminator Forms – Contact Form
Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function in all versions up to
and including
1.44.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s to include arbitrary file paths in a form submission. The file will be deleted when the form submission is deleted
whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings. This can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
