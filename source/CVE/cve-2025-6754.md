Description : The SEO Metrics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization checks in both the seo_metrics_handle_connect_button_click() AJAX handler and the seo_metrics_handle_custom_endpoint() function in versions 1.0.5 through 1.0.15. Because the AJAX action only verifies a nonce
without checking the caller’s capabilities
a subscriber-level user can retrieve the token and then access the custom endpoint to obtain full administrator cookies.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
