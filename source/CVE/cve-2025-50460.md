Description : A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the ms-swift project version 3.3.0 due to unsafe deserialization in tests/run.py using yaml.load() from the PyYAML library (versions = 5.3.1). If an  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]] can control the content of the YAML configuration file passed to the --run_config parameter
arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization. This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML file is loaded
allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher
and to use yaml.safe_load() to mitigate the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
