Description : AutoGPT versions 0.3.4 and earlier are vulnerable to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that could lead to Remote Code Execution ([[RCE]]). The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of user-supplied format strings in the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation
where malicious input is passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. [[Attacker]]s can [[exploit]] this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The issue is fixed in version 0.4.0.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
