Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()

When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw()
it doesn't guarantee to
return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that
leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid
array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported
actually when connected with a bad adapter.

Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner
cases
and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.

(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)

Severity: 0.0 | NA
