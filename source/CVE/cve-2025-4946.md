Description : The Vikinger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the vikinger_delete_activity_media_ajax() function in all versions up to
and including
1.9.32. This makes it possible for authenticated  [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[attacker]]]]]]]]]]]]s
with Subscriber-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). Note: Requires Vikinger Media plugin to be installed and active.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
