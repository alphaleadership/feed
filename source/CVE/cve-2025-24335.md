Description : Nokia Single RAN baseband software versions earlier than 24R1-SR 2.1 MP contain a SOAP message input validation flaw
which in theory could potentially be used for causing resource exhaustion in the Single RAN baseband OAM service.

No practical  [[ [[ [[ [[exploit]]]]]]]] has been detected for this flaw. However
the issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 2.1 MP by adding sufficient input validation for received SOAP requests
effectively mitigating the reported issue.

Severity: 2.0 | LOW
