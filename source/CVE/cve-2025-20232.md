a LOW-privileged user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky command using the [[permission]]s of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands on the “/app/search/search“ endpoint through its “s“ parameter. 
The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to [[exploit]] the vulnerability at will.

Severity: 5.7 | MEDIUM
