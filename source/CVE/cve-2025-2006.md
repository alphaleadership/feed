Description : The Inline Image Upload for BBPress [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to arbitrary [[file]] uploads due to [[missing]] [[file]] type validation in the [[file]] uploading functionality in all versions up to
and including

with Subscriber-level access and above
to upload arbitrary [[file]]s on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This may be [[exploit]]able by unauthenticated [[attacker]]s when the "Allow guest users without accounts to create topics and replies" setting is enabled.
