Description : An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. During login at the /system/auth/login/ endpoint
the system's response times differ depending on whether a user exists in the system. The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password (e.g.
more than 100 milliseconds).

Severity: 5.3 | [[MEDIUM]]
