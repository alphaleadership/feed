Description : The Code Clone [[plugin]] for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to time-based [[SQL]] Injection via the ‘snippetId’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
0.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to append additional [[SQL]] queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

Severity: 4.9 | [[MEDIUM]]
