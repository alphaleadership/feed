During 2025
the threat-intelligence firm Synthient aggregated 2 billion unique email addresses disclosed in credential-stuffing lists found across multiple malicious internet sources. Comprised of email addresses and passwords from previous data breaches
these lists are used by attackers to compromise other
unrelated accounts of victims who have reused their passwords. The data also included 1.3 billion unique passwords
which are now searchable in Pwned Passwords.
