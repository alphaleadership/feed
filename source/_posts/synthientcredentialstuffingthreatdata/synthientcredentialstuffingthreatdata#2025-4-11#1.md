# Synthient Credential Stuffing Threat Data - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2025-04-11  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 1 957 476 021

## Description
During 2025, the threat-intelligence firm Synthient aggregated 2 billion unique email addresses disclosed in credential-stuffing lists found across multiple malicious internet sources. Comprised of email addresses and passwords from previous data breaches, these lists are used by attackers to compromise other, unrelated accounts of victims who have reused their passwords. The data also included 1.3 billion unique passwords, which are now searchable in Pwned Passwords. Working to turn breached data into awareness, Synthient partnered with HIBP to help victims of cybercrime understand their exposure.
