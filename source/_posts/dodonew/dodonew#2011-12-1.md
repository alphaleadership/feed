# Dodonew.com - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2011-12-01  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 8 718 404

## Description
In late 2011, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as Dodonew.com and contained 8.7M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email addresses and user names. Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.
