Description : The BoomBox Theme Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
1.8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the 'boombox_ajax_reset_password' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level privileges and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
