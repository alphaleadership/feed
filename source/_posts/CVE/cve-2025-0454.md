Description : A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the Requests utility of significant-gravitas/autogpt versions prior to v0.4.0. The vulnerability arises due to a hostname confusion between the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the `requests` library. A malicious user can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL
such as `http://localhost:\@google.com/../`
to bypass the SSRF check and perform an SSRF attack.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
