Description : In mlflow/mlflow version 2.17.2
the `/graphql` endpoint is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. An attacker can create large batches of queries that repeatedly request all runs from a given experiment. This can tie up all the workers allocated by MLFlow
rendering the application unable to respond to other requests. This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption.

Severity: 5.9 | MEDIUM
