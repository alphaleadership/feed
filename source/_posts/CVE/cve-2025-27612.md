Description : libcontainer is a library for container control. Prior to libcontainer 0.5.3
while creating a tenant container
the tenant builder accepts a list of capabilities to be added in the spec of tenant container. The logic here adds the given capabilities to all capabilities of main container if present in spec
otherwise simply set provided capabilities as capabilities of the tenant container. However
setting inherited caps in any case for tenant container can lead to elevation of capabilities
similar to CVE-2022-29162. This does not affect youki binary itself. This is only applicable if you are using libcontainer directly and using the tenant builder.

Severity: 5.9 | MEDIUM
