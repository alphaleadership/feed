Description : An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. Bypassing of Device Pairing can occur. It uses MAC address verification as the sole mechanism for recognizing paired devices
allowing attackers to bypass authentication. By capturing the MAC address of an already-paired device through ARP scanning or other means
an attacker can spoof the MAC address and connect to the dashcam without going through the pairing process. This enables full access to the device.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
