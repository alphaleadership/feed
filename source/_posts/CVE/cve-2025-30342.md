Description : An XSS issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When submitting descriptions such as Moderator Notes or Agenda Topics
an editor is shown that allows one to format the submitted text. This allows insertion of various HTML elements. When trying to insert a SCRIPT element
it is properly encoded when reflected; however
adding attributes to links is possible
which allows the injection of JavaScript via the onmouseover attribute and others. When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link
JavaScript is executed in that user's session.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM
