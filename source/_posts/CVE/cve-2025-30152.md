Description : The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Teamâ€™s plugin for the PayPal Commerce Platform. Prior to 1.6.2
1.7.2
and 2.0.2
a discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns to the order summary page
they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the order. As a result
the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured by PayPal
leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full payment. The issue is fixed in versions: 1.6.2
1.7.2
2.0.2 and above.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
