CVE ID : CVE-2025-23204

Description : API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs. Starting in version 3.3.8
a security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced by another one as there's no break in a clause. As this falls back to `security`
the impact is there only when there's only a security after resolver and none inside security. The test in version 3.3.8 is probably broken. As of time of publication
a fixed version is not available.

Severity: 4.4 | MEDIUM
