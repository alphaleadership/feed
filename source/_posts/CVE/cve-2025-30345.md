Description : An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When creating new chats via the chat_group.create action
the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements such as SCRIPT are filtered
whereas others are not. In most cases
HTML entities are encoded properly
but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website
but it is unlikely that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.

Severity: 3.5 | LOW
