## Description
In August 2022, customer data of the Indian shopping site "LBB" \(Little Black Book\) was posted to a popular hacking forum. The data contained over 3M records with 39k unique email addresses alongside IP and physical addresses, names and device information with the most recent data dating back to early 2019.
