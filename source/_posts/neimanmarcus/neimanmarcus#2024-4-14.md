## Description
In May 2024, the American luxury retailer Neiman Marcus suffered a data breach which was later posted to a popular hacking forum. The data included 31M unique email addresses, names, phone numbers, dates of birth, physical addresses and partial credit card data \(note: this is insufficient to make purchases\). The breach was traced back to a series of attacks against the Snowflake cloud service which impacted 165 organisations worldwide.
