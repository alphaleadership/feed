In November 2025
Beckett Collectibles experienced a data breach accompanied by website content defacement. The stolen data was later advertised for sale on a prominent hacking forum
with portions subsequently released publicly. The publicly circulating data included more than 500k email addresses reportedly belonging to North American customers
along with a smaller subset containing names
usernames
phone numbers and physical addresses.
