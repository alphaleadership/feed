In September 2025
Prosper announced that it had detected unauthorised access to their systems
which resulted in the exposure of customer and applicant information. The data breach impacted 17.6M unique email addresses
along with other customer information
including US Social Security numbers. Prosper advised that they did not find any evidence of unauthorised access to customer accounts and funds
and that their customer-facing operations were uninterrupted. Further information about the incident is contained in Prosper's FAQs.
