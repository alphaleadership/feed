# Netshoes - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2017-12-07  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 499 836

## Description
In December 2017, the online Brazilian retailer known as Netshoes had half a million records allegedly hacked from their system posted publicly. The company was contacted by local Brazilian media outlet Tecmundo and subsequently advised that no indications have been identified of an invasion of the company's systems. However, Netshoes' own systems successfully confirm the presence of matching identifiers and email addresses from the data set, indicating a high likelihood that the data originated from them.
