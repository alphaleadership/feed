# Zacks - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2020-05-10  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 8 929 503

## Description
In December 2022, the investment research company Zacks announced a data breach. The following month, reports emerged of the incident impacting 820k customers. However, in June 2023, a corpus of data with almost 9M Zacks customers appeared before being broadly circulated on a popular hacking forum. The most recent data was dated May 2020 and included names, usernames, email and physical addresses, phone numbers and passwords stored as unsalted SHA-256 hashes. On disclosure of the larger breach, Zacks advised that in addition to their original report "the unauthorised third parties also gained access to encrypted \[sic\] passwords of zacks.com customers, but only in the encrypted \[sic\] format".
