# MSI - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2024-07-07  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 249 990

## Description
In July 2024, MSI inadvertently exposed hundreds of thousands of customer records related to RMA claims that were subsequently found to be publicly accessible. The data included 250k unique email addresses alongside names, phone numbers, physical addresses and warranty claims. When contacted about the incident, MSI advised that "there is no evidence the information was ever accessed" and that "the security incident we had did not trigger state data breach notification obligations" due to the absence of "\(social security number, driver's license number….etc\)".
