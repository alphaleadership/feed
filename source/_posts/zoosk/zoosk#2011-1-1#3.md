# Zoosk  - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2011-01-01  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 52 578 183

## Description
In approximately 2011, an alleged breach of the dating website Zoosk began circulating. Comprised of almost 53 million records, the data contained email addresses and plain text passwords. However, during extensive verification in May 2016 no evidence could be found that the data was indeed sourced from the dating service. This breach has consequently been flagged as fabricated; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Zoosk.
