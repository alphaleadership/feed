# Adobe - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2013-10-04  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 152 445 165

## Description
In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached with each containing an internal ID, username, email, encrypted password and a password hint in plain text. The password cryptography was poorly done and many were quickly resolved back to plain text. The unencrypted hints also disclosed much about the passwords adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.
