In June 2025
headlines erupted over a "16 billion password" breach. In reality
the dataset was a compilation of publicly accessible stealer logs
mostly repurposed from older leaks
with only a small portion of genuinely new material. HIBP received 2.7B rows containing 109M unique email addresses
which was subsequently added to the service under the name "Data Troll". The websites the stealer logs were captured against are searchable via the HIBP dashboard.
