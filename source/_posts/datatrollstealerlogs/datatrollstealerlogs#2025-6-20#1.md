# Data Troll Stealer Logs - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2025-06-20  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 109 532 219

## Description
In June 2025, headlines erupted over a "16 billion password" breach. In reality, the dataset was a compilation of publicly accessible stealer logs, mostly repurposed from older leaks, with only a small portion of genuinely new material. HIBP received 2.7B rows containing 109M unique email addresses, which was subsequently added to the service under the name "Data Troll". The websites the stealer logs were captured against are searchable via the HIBP dashboard.
