# Aipai.com - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2016-09-27  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 6 496 778

## Description
In September 2016, data allegedly obtained from the Chinese gaming website known as Aipai.com and containing 6.5M accounts was leaked online. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email addresses and MD5 password hashes. Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.
