# Qatar National Bank - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2015-07-01  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 88 678

## Description
In July 2015, the Qatar National Bank suffered a data breach which exposed 15k documents totalling 1.4GB and detailing more than 100k accounts with passwords and PINs. The incident was made public some 9 months later in April 2016 when the documents appeared publicly on a file sharing site. Analysis of the breached data suggests the attack began by exploiting a SQL injection flaw in the bank's website.
