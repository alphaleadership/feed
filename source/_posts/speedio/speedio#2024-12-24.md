# Speedio - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2024-12-24  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 27 501 041

## Description
In December 2024, data alleged to have been taken from the Brazilian lead generation platform Speedio was posted for sale to a popular hacking forum. The data was allegedly obtained from an unsecured Elasticsearch instance and contained over 62M records of largely public business information including company names, phone numbers and physical addresses, along with 27M unique email addresses, predominantly from public services such as Gmail and Outlook. Speedio did not respond to multiple attempts to disclose the incident, and the origin of the data could not be independently verified.
