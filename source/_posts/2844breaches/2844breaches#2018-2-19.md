# 2,844 Separate Data Breaches - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2018-02-19  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 80 115 532

## Description
In February 2018, a massive collection of almost 3,000 alleged data breaches was found online. Whilst some of the data had previously been seen in Have I Been Pwned, 2,844 of the files consisting of more than 80 million unique email addresses had not previously been seen. Each file contained both an email address and plain text password and were consequently loaded as a single "unverified" data breach.
