# Civil Online - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2011-07-10  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 7 830 195

## Description
In mid-2011, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese engineering website known as Civil Online and contained 7.8M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and MD5 password hashes. Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.
