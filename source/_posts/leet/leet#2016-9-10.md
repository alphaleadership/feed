**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 5 081 689

## Description
In August 2016, the service for creating and running Pocket Minecraft edition servers known as Leet was reported as having suffered a data breach that impacted 6 million subscribers. The incident reported by Softpedia had allegedly taken place earlier in the year, although the data set sent to HIBP was dated as recently as early September but contained only 2 million subscribers. The data included usernames, email and IP addresses and SHA512 hashes. A further 3 million accounts were obtained and added to HIBP several days after the initial data was loaded bringing the total to over 5 million.
