# Florida Virtual School - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2018-02-12  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 542 902

## Description
In March 2018, the Florida Virtual School FLVS posted a data breach notification to their website. The school had identified a data breach which had occurred sometime between 6 May 2016 and 12 Feb 2018 and an XML file containing 368k student records was subsequently found circulating. Each record contained student name, date of birth, password, grade, email and parent email resulting in a total of 543k unique email addresses. Due to the prevalence of email addresses belonging to individuals who are still legally children, the data breach has been flagged as "sensitive".
