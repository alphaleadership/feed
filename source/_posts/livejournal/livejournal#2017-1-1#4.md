# LiveJournal - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2017-01-01  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 26 372 781

## Description
In mid-2019, news broke of an alleged LiveJournal data breach. This followed multiple reports of credential abuse against Dreamwidth beginning in 2018, a fork of LiveJournal with a significant crossover in user base. The breach allegedly dates back to 2017 and contains 26M unique usernames and email addresses \(both of which have been confirmed to exist on LiveJournal\) alongside plain text passwords. An archive of the data was subsequently shared on a popular hacking forum in May 2020 and redistributed broadly.
