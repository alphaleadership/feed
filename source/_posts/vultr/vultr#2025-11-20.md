In March 2023
the "AI-first global cloud platform" Vultr disclosed a security incident at a third-party vendor. Dating back to the previous year
the incident was attributed to the ActiveCampaign email marketing service provider and resulted in the exposure of 188k unique email addresses. A small number of records also included name
IP address and country of origin. No Vultr systems or additional customer data were impacted. Vultr subsequently self-submitted the impacted data to HIBP.
