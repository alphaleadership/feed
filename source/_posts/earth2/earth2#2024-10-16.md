# Earth 2 - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2024-10-16  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 420 961

## Description
In October 2024, 421k unique email addresses from the virtual earth game Earth 2 were derived from embedded Gravatar images. Appearing alongside player usernames, the root cause was related to how Gravatar presents links to avatars as MD5 hashes within consuming services, a feature Earth 2 advised has now been disabled on their platform. This incident did not expose any further personal information, passwords or financial data.
