# NetEase - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2015-10-19  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 234 842 089

## Description
In October 2015, the Chinese site known as NetEase located at 163.com was reported as having suffered a data breach that impacted hundreds of millions of subscribers. Whilst there is evidence that the data itself is legitimate multiple HIBP subscribers confirmed a password they use is in the data, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email addresses and plain text passwords. Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.
