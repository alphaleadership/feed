# Bin Weevils - Fuite de données

## Description
In September 2014, the online game Bin Weevils suffered a data breach. Whilst originally stating that only usernames and passwords had been exposed, a subsequent story on DataBreaches.net indicated that a more extensive set of personal attributes were impacted comments there also suggest the data may have come from a later breach. Data matching that pattern was later provided to Have I Been Pwned by @akshayindia6 and included almost 1.3m unique email addresses, genders, ages and plain text passwords.
