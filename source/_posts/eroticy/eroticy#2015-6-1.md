# Eroticy - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2015-06-01  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 1 370 175

## Description
In mid-2016, it's alleged that the adult website known as  Eroticy was hacked. Almost 1.4 million unique accounts were found circulating in late 2016 which contained a raft of personal information ranging from email addresses to phone numbers to plain text passwords. Whilst many HIBP subscribers confirmed their data was legitimate, the actual source of the breach remains inconclusive. A detailed account of the data has been published in the hope of identifying the origin of the breach.
