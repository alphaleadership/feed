# Gemini - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2022-12-13  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 5 274 214

## Description
In late 2022, a hacker posted a data set to a public hacking forum which they alleged was sourced from the Gemini crypto exchange, a claim that was later proven to be false as the data was traced back to an incident at a third-party vendor. The source of the breach was later established as being Twilio, who processed the data of some Gemini customers using their Authy service for 2FA. Twilio described the incident as stemming from a sophisticated social engineering attack designed to steal employee credentials.
