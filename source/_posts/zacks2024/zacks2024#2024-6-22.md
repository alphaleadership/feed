# Zacks \(2024\) - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2024-06-22  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 11 994 223

## Description
In June 2024, the investment research company Zacks was allegedly breached, and data was later published to a popular hacking forum. This comes after a separate Zacks data breach confirmed by the organisation in 2023 with the subsequent breach disclosing millions of additional records representing a superset of data from the first incident. The 2024 breach included 12M unique email addresses along with IP and physical addresses, names, usernames, phone numbers and unsalted SHA-256 password hashes. Zacks did not respond to multiple attempts to contact them about the incident.
