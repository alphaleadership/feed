# MGM Resorts  - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2019-07-25  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 24 842 001

## Description
In July 2019, MGM Resorts discovered a data breach of one of their cloud services. The breach included 10.6M guest records with 3.1M unique email addresses stemming back to 2017. In May 2022, a superset of the data totalling almost 25M unique email addresses across 142M rows was extensively shared on Telegram. On analysis, it's highly likely the data stems from the same incident with 142M records having been discovered for sale on a dark web marketplace in mid-2020. The exposed data included email and physical addresses, names, phone numbers and dates of birth.
