Between 10 and 13 November 2025
the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol's headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealer Rhadamanthys
the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT
and the botnet Elysium
all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers and provided 2 million impacted email addresses and 7.4 million passwords to HIBP.
