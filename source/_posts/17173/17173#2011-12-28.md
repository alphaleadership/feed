# 17173 - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2011-12-28  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 7 485 802

## Description
In late 2011, a series of data breaches in China affected up to 100 million users, including 7.5 million from the gaming site known as 17173. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains usernames, email addresses and salted MD5 password hashes and was provided with support from dehashed.com. Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.
