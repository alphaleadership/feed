# ActMobile - Fuite de données

**Date de la fuite** : 2021-10-08  
**Nombre de comptes affectés** : 1 583 193

## Description
In October 2021, security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered an exposed database he attributed to ActMobile, the operators of Dash VPN and FreeVPN. The exposed data included 1.6 million unique email addresses along with IP addresses and password hashes, all of which were subsequently leaked on a popular hacking forum. Although usage of the service was verified by HIBP subscribers, ActMobile denied the data was sourced from them and the breach has subsequently been flagged as "unverified".
