Description : A vulnerability has been found in Dahua products.

Attackers could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability by sending specially crafted malicious packets
potentially causing service disruption (e.g.
crashes) or remote code execution (RCE). Some devices may have deployed protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
which reduces the likelihood of successful RCE exploitation. However
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks remain a concern.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
