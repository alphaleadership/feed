Description : The Event List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to
and including
2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's capabilities prior to updating their profile in the el_update_profile() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to change their capabilities to those of an administrator.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
