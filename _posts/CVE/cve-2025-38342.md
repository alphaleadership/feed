Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

software node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()

software_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element
so
the property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes
but that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check
and may cause OOB
for malformed property.

Fix by using as OOB check '((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)'.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
