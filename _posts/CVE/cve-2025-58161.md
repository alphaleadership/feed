Description : MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. In version 4.4.0
the GET /download/ route uses string path verification via os.path.commonprefix
which allows an authenticated user to download files outside the DWD_DIR download directory from "neighboring" directories whose absolute paths begin with the same prefix as DWD_DIR (e.g.
.../downloads_bak
.../downloads.old). This is a Directory Traversal (escape) leading to a data leak. This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1.

Severity: 1.3 | LOW
