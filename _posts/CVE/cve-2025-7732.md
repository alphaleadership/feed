Description : The Lazy Load for Videos plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its lazy‑loading handlers in all versions up to
and including
2.18.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The plugin’s JavaScript registration handlers read the client‑supplied 'data-video-title' and 'href' attributes
decode HTML entities by default
and pass them directly into DOM sinks without any escaping or validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM
