Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powercap: dtpm_cpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in get_pd_power_uw()

The get_pd_power_uw() function can crash with a NULL pointer dereference
when em_cpu_get() returns NULL. This occurs when a CPU becomes impossible
during runtime
causing get_cpu_device() to return NULL
which propagates
through em_cpu_get() and leads to a crash when em_span_cpus() dereferences
the NULL pointer.

Add a NULL check after em_cpu_get() and return 0 if unavailable
matching the existing fallback behavior in __dtpm_cpu_setup().

[ rjw: Drop an excess empty code line ]

Severity: 0.0 | NA
