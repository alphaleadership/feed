Description : Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.2.4 and below
attackers can achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the target's machine. Once a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP
the attacker can silently swap it for a malicious command (e.g.
calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt. If an attacker has write permissions on a user's active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved
or allows an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally
the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 1.3.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH
