Description : An Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read vulnerability affects the
Agent when installed on a system. The parameter filename does not validate the
path thus allowing users to read arbitrary files. As
the application runs with the highest privileges (root/NT_AUTHORITY SYSTEM)
by default attackers are able to obtain sensitive information.

This issue affects Avid NEXIS E-series: before 2025.5.1; Avid NEXIS F-series: before 2025.5.1; Avid NEXIS PRO+: before 2025.5.1; System Director Appliance (SDA+): before 2025.5.1.
