Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Disable INVLPGB on Zen2

AMD Cyan Skillfish (Family 17h
Model 47h
Stepping 0h) has an issue
that causes system oopses and panics when performing TLB flush using
INVLPGB.

However
the problem is that that machine has misconfigured CPUID and
should not report the INVLPGB bit in the first place. So zap the
kernel's representation of the flag so that nothing gets confused.
