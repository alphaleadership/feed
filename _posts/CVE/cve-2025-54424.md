Description : 1Panel is a web interface and MCP Server that manages websites
files
containers
databases
and LLMs on a Linux server. In versions 2.0.5 and below
the HTTPS protocol used for communication between the Core and Agent endpoints has incomplete certificate verification during certificate validation
leading to unauthorized interface access. Due to the presence of numerous command execution or high-privilege interfaces in 1Panel
this results in Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is fixed in version 2.0.6. The CVE has been translated from Simplified Chinese using GitHub Copilot.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
