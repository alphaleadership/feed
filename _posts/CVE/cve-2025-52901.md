access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and
in consequence
to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.
