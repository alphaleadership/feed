Description : Digital Music Pad v8.2.3.3.4 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its playlist file parser. When opening a .pls file containing an excessively long string in the File1 field
the application fails to properly validate input length
resulting in corruption of the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) on the stack. This flaw may allow an attacker to control execution flow when the file is opened
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Severity: 8.4 | HIGH
