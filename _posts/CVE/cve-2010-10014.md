Description : Odin Secure FTP <= 4.1 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing directory listings received in response to an FTP LIST command. A malicious FTP server can send an overly long filename in the directory listing
which overflows a fixed-size stack buffer in the client and overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH). This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the client system.

Severity: 8.7 | HIGH
