Description : In ConnectWise PSA versions older than 2025.9
a
vulnerability exists where authenticated users could gain access to sensitive
user information. Specific API requests were found to return an overly verbose
user object
which included encrypted password hashes for other users.
Authenticated users could then retrieve these hashes. 



An
attacker or privileged user could then use these exposed hashes to conduct
offline brute-force or dictionary attacks. Such attacks could lead to
credential compromise
allowing unauthorized access to accounts
and
potentially privilege escalation within the system.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
