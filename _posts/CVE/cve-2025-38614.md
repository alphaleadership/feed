Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion

Ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
EP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.

Currently
ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks
but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - They don't look upwards in the tree.
 - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths
only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths").

Essentially
the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

A more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks
among other things
that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. However
this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

As a result
it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500
tested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 ("eventpoll: Fix priority inversion
problem").)

To fix it:

1. In ep_loop_check_proc()
note the subtree depth of each visited node
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. In ep_loop_check()
use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
