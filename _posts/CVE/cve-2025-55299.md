Description : VaulTLS is a modern solution for managing mTLS (mutual TLS) certificates. Prior to 0.9.1
user accounts created through the User web UI have an empty but not NULL password set
attackers can use this to login with an empty password. This is combined with that fact
that previously disabling the password based login only effected the frontend
but still allowed login via the API. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1.

Severity: 9.4 | CRITICAL
