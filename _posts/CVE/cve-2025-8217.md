Description : The Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension v1.84.0 contains inert
injected code designed to call the Q Developer CLI. The code executes when the extension is launched within the VS Code environment; however the injected code contains a syntax error which prevents it from making a successful API call to the Q Developer CLI.



To mitigate this issue
users should upgrade to version v1.85.0. All installations of v1.84.0 should be removed from use.

Severity: 4.0 | MEDIUM
