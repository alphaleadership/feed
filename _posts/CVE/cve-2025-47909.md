Description : Hosts listed in TrustedOrigins implicitly allow requests from the corresponding HTTP origins
allowing network MitMs to perform CSRF attacks. After the CVE-2025-24358 fix
a network attacker that places a form at http://example.com can't get it to submit to https://example.com because the Origin header is checked with sameOrigin against a synthetic URL. However
if a host is added to TrustedOrigins
both its HTTP and HTTPS origins will be allowed
because the schema of the synthetic URL is ignored and only the host is checked. For example
if an application is hosted on https://example.com and adds example.net to TrustedOrigins
a network attacker can serve a form at http://example.net to perform the attack. Applications should migrate to net/http.CrossOriginProtection
introduced in Go 1.25. If that is not an option
a backport is available as a module at filippo.io/csrf
and a drop-in replacement for the github.com/gorilla/csrf API is available at filippo.io/csrf/gorilla.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
