Description : An authorization bypass vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance (legacy CG and NXG SaaS platforms). By appending a specific URI suffix to certain API endpoints
an unauthenticated attacker can bypass access control checks and retrieve limited sensitive resources. The root cause was a misconfiguration in API authorization logic
which has since been corrected in SE.2025.1 and 2025.1.2.
