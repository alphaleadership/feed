Description : SPON IP Network Broadcast System
a digital audio transmission platform developed by SPON Communications
contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the rj_get_token.php endpoint. The flaw arises from insufficient input validation on the jsondata[url] parameter
which allows attackers to perform directory traversal and access sensitive files on the server. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to read arbitrary files
potentially exposing system configuration
credentials
or internal logic. An affected version range is undefined.

Severity: 8.7 | HIGH
