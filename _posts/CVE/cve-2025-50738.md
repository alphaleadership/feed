Description : The Memos application
up to version v0.24.3
allows for the embedding of markdown images with arbitrary URLs. When a user views a memo containing such an image
their browser automatically fetches the image URL without explicit user consent or interaction beyond viewing the memo. This can be exploited by an attacker to disclose the viewing user's IP address
browser User-Agent string
and potentially other request-specific information to the attacker-controlled server
leading to information disclosure and user tracking.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
