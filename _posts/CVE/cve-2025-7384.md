Description : The Database for Contact Form 7
WPforms
Elementor forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
1.4.3 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_lead_detail function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin
which is likely to be used alongside
allows attackers to delete arbitrary files
leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
