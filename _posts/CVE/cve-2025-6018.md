Description : A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example
a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present
"allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions
which are typically restricted to console users
potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations
services
or other sensitive operations.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH
