Description : An authenticated multi-stage remote code execution vulnerability exists in Riverbed SteelCentral NetProfiler and NetExpress 10.8.7 virtual appliances. A SQL injection vulnerability in the '/api/common/1.0/login' endpoint can be exploited to create a new user account in the appliance database. This user can then trigger a command injection vulnerability in the '/index.php?page=licenses' endpoint to execute arbitrary commands. The attacker may escalate privileges to root by exploiting an insecure sudoers configuration that allows the 'mazu' user to execute arbitrary commands as root via SSH key extraction and command chaining. Successful exploitation allows full remote root access to the virtual appliance.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
