Description : nginx-defender is a high-performance
enterprise-grade Web Application Firewall (WAF) and threat detection system engineered for modern web infrastructure. This is a configuration vulnerability affecting nginx-defender deployments. Example configuration files
config.yaml and docker-compose.yml contain default credentials (default_password: "change_me_please"
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123). If users deploy nginx-defender without changing these defaults
attackers with network access could gain administrative control
bypassing security protections. The issue is addressed in v1.5.0 and later.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
