Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy

If a PHY has no driver
the genphy driver is probed/removed directly in
phy_attach/detach. If the PHY's ofnode has an "leds" subnode
then the
LEDs will be (un)registered when probing/removing the genphy driver.
This could occur if the leds are for a non-generic driver that isn't
loaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in
phy_detach leads to the following deadlock:

rtnl_lock()
ndo_close()
    ...
    phy_detach()
        phy_remove()
            phy_leds_unregister()
                led_classdev_unregister()
                    led_trigger_set()
                        netdev_trigger_deactivate()
                            unregister_netdevice_notifier()
                                rtnl_lock()

There is a corresponding deadlock on the open/register side of things
(and that one is reported by lockdep)
but it requires a race while this
one is deterministic.

Generic PHYs do not support LEDs anyway
so don't bother registering
them.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
