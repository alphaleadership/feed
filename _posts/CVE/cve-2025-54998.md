Description : OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage
store
and distribute sensitive data including secrets
certificates
and keys. In versions 0.1.0 through 2.3.1
attackers could bypass the automatic user lockout mechanisms in the OpenBao Userpass or LDAP auth systems. This was caused by different aliasing between pre-flight and full login request user entity alias attributions. This is fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around this issue
existing users may apply rate-limiting quotas on the authentication endpoints:
see https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
