Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write

memcg_path_store() assigns a newly allocated memory buffer to
filter->memcg_path
without deallocating the previously allocated and
assigned memory buffer.  As a result
users can leak kernel memory by
continuously writing a data to memcg_path DAMOS sysfs file.  Fix the leak
by deallocating the previously set memory buffer.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
