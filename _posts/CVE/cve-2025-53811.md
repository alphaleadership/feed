Description : The configuration of Mosh-Pro on macOS
specifically the "RunAsNode" fuse enabled
allows a local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Mosh-Pro TCC (Transparency
Consent
and Control) permissions. 
Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Mosh-Pro
potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent. 

This issue was detected in 1.3.2 version of Mosh-Pro. Since authors did not respond to messages from CNA
patching status is unknown.

Severity: 4.8 | MEDIUM
