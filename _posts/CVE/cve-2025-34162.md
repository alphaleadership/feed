Description : An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the GetLyfsByParams endpoint of Bian Que Feijiu Intelligent Emergency and Quality Control System
accessible via the /AppService/BQMedical/WebServiceForFirstaidApp.asmx interface. The backend fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the strOpid parameter
allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL statements. This can lead to data exfiltration
authentication bypass
and potentially remote code execution
depending on backend configuration. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to June 2025 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product
though the exact affected range remains undefined.

Severity: 9.3 | CRITICAL
