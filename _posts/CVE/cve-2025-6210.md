Description : A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository
specifically in version 0.12.27
allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files
such as /etc/passwd
by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method
where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.

Severity: 6.2 | MEDIUM
