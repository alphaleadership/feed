Description : h2 is a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol stack. Prior to version 4.3.0
an HTTP/2 request splitting vulnerability allows attackers to perform request smuggling attacks by injecting CRLF characters into headers. This occurs when servers downgrade HTTP/2 requests to HTTP/1.1 without properly validating header names/values
enabling attackers to manipulate request boundaries and bypass security controls. This issue has been patched in version 4.3.0.

Severity: 6.9 | MEDIUM
