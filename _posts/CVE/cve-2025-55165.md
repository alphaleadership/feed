Description : Autocaliweb is a web app that offers an interface for browsing
reading
and downloading eBooks using a valid Calibre database. Prior to version 0.8.3
the debug pack generated by Autocaliweb can expose sensitive configuration data
including API keys. This occurs because the to_dict() method
used to serialize configuration for the debug pack
doesn't adequately filter out sensitive fields such as API tokens. Users
unaware of the full contents
might share these debug packs
inadvertently leaking their private API keys. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.3.

Severity: 8.2 | HIGH
