Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails

The reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link.
When renaming
the file0's inode is marked as a bad inode because the file
name cannot be deleted.

The underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode.
In some cases it's "icache lookup finds a normal inode
d_splice_alias()
is called to attach it to dentry
while another thread decides to call
make_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache
but we'd already
found it there earlier".
In some it's outright "we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we
got it in the first place; let's call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits
and giggles".

Severity: 0.0 | NA
