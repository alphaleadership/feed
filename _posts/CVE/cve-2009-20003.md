Description : Xenorate versions up to and including 2.50
a Windows-based multimedia player
is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing .xpl playlist files. The application fails to properly validate the length of input data
allowing an attacker to craft a malicious .xpl file that overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and enables arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires local interaction
typically by convincing a user to open the crafted file.

Severity: 8.4 | HIGH
