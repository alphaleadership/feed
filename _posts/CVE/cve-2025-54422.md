Description : Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. In versions 1.16.1 and below
a critical security vulnerability exists in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation
user passwords are transmitted via shared memory
exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly severe during password modification operations
where both old and new passwords are passed as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation. This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session
including unprivileged processes
to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments
thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk. This is fixed in version 1.16.2.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
