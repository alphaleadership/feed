Description : An Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability in the SIP ALG of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC allows an unauthenticated
network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When an MX Series device with an MS-MPC is configured with two or more service sets which are both processing SIP calls
a specific sequence of call events will lead to a crash and restart of the MS-MPC.
This issue affects Junos OS:



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  21.4 versions from 21.4R1
*  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6
*  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6.




As the MS-MPC is EoL after Junos OS 22.4
later versions are not affected.

This issue does not affect MX-SPC3 or SRX Series devices.

Severity: 5.9 | MEDIUM
