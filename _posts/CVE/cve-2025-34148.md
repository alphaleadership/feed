Description : An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Shenzhen Aitemi M300 Wi-Fi Repeater (hardware model MT02). When configuring the device in WISP mode
the 'ssid' parameter is passed unsanitized to system-level scripts. This allows remote attackers within Wi-Fi range to inject arbitrary shell commands that execute as root
resulting in full device compromise.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
