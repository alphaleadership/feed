Description : LocalSend is an open-source app to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over local networks without needing an internet connection. In versions 1.16.1 and below
a critical Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability in the software's discovery protocol allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same local network to impersonate legitimate devices
silently intercepting
reading
and modifying any file transfer. This can be used to steal sensitive data or inject malware
like ransomware
into files shared between trusted users. The attack is hardly detectable and easy to implement
posing a severe and immediate security risk. This issue was fixed in version 1.17.0.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
