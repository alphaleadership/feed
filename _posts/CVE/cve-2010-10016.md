Description : BS.Player version 2.57 (build 1051) contains a vulnerability in its playlist import functionality. When processing .m3u files
the application fails to properly validate the length of playlist entries
resulting in a buffer overflow condition. This flaw occurs during parsing of long URLs embedded in the playlist
allowing overwrite of Structured Exception Handler (SEH) records. The vulnerability is triggered upon opening a crafted playlist file and affects the Unicode parsing logic in the Windows client.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL
