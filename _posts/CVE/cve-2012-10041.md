Description : WAN Emulator v2.3 contains two unauthenticated command execution vulnerabilities. The result.php script calls shell_exec() with unsanitized input from the pc POST parameter
allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as the www-data user. The system also includes a SUID-root binary named dosu
which is vulnerable to command injection via its first argument. An attacker can exploit both flaws in sequence to achieve full remote code execution and escalate privileges to root.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
