Description : OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage
store
and distribute sensitive data including secrets
certificates
and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below
some OpenBao deployments intentionally limit privileged API operators from executing system code or making network connections. However
these operators can bypass both restrictions through the audit subsystem by manipulating log prefixes. This allows unauthorized code execution and network access that violates the intended security model. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.2. To workaround
users can block access to sys/audit/* endpoints using explicit deny policies
but root operators cannot be restricted this way.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL
