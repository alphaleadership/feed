Description : A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index library's JsonPickleSerializer component
affecting versions v0.12.27 through v0.12.40. This vulnerability allows remote code execution due to an insecure fallback to Python's pickle module. JsonPickleSerializer prioritizes deserialization using pickle.loads()
which can execute arbitrary code when processing untrusted data. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious payloads to achieve full system compromise. The root cause includes an insecure fallback mechanism
lack of validation or safeguards
misleading design
and violation of Python security guidelines.

Severity: 5.0 | MEDIUM
