Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: handle jset (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation

BPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently verifier.c:can_jump()
does not know about that. This can lead to incorrect live registers
and SCC computation.

E.g. in the following example:

   1: r0 = 1;
   2: r2 = 2;
   3: if r1 & 0x7 goto +1;
   4: exit;
   5: r0 = r2;
   6: exit;

W/o this fix insn_successors(3) will return only (4)
a jump to (5)
would be missed and r2 won't be marked as alive at (3).

Severity: 0.0 | NA
