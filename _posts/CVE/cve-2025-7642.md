Description : The Simpler Checkout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions 0.7.0 to 1.1.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in as an admin through the simplerwc_woocommerce_order_created() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users based on their order ID
which can be an administrator if a site admin has placed a test order.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
