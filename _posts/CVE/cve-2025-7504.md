with subscriber-level access and above
to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software

it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files
retrieve sensitive data
or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This requires access to the sites SALT_NONCE and and SALT_KEY to exploit.
