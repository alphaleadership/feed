Description : ComSndFTP FTP Server version 1.3.7 Beta contains a format string vulnerability in its handling of the USER command. By sending a specially crafted username containing format specifiers
a remote attacker can overwrite a hardcoded function pointer in memory (specifically WSACleanup from Ws2_32.dll). This allows the attacker to redirect execution flow and bypass DEP protections using a ROP chain
ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication and affects default configurations.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
