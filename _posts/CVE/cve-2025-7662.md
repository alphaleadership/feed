Description : The Gestion de tarifs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'tarif' and 'intitule' shortcodes in all versions up to
and including
1.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
