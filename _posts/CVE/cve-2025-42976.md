Description : SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP (BIC Document) allows an authenticated attacker to craft a request that
when submitted to a BIC Document application
could cause a memory corruption error. On successful exploitation
this results in the crash of the target component. Multiple submissions can make the target completely unavailable. A similarly crafted submission can be used to perform an out-of-bounds read operation as well
revealing sensitive information that is loaded in memory at that time. There is no ability to modify any information.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
