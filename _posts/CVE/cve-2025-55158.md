Description : Vim is an open source
command line text editor. In versions from 9.1.1231 to before 9.1.1406
when processing nested tuples during Vim9 script import operations
an error during evaluation can trigger a double-free in Vim’s internal typed value (typval_T) management. Specifically
the clear_tv() function may attempt to free memory that has already been deallocated
due to improper lifetime handling in the handle_import / ex_import code paths. The vulnerability can only be triggered if a user explicitly opens and executes a specially crafted Vim script. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.1406.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
