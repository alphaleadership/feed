Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes
potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast()
gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption
it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one()
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
