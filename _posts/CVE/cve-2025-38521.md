Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: Fix kernel crash when hard resetting the GPU

The GPU hard reset sequence calls pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume()
which according to their documentation should
only be used during system-wide PM transitions to sleep states.

The main issue though is that depending on some internal runtime PM
state as seen by pm_runtime_force_suspend() (whether the usage count is
<= 1)
pm_runtime_force_resume() might not resume the device unless
needed. If that happens
the runtime PM resume callback
pvr_power_device_resume() is not called
the GPU clocks are not
re-enabled
and the kernel crashes on the next attempt to access GPU
registers as part of the power-on sequence.

Replace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume() with direct calls to the driver's runtime PM
callbacks
pvr_power_device_suspend() and pvr_power_device_resume()
to ensure clocks are re-enabled and avoid the kernel crash.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
