Description : @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software templates. Prior to version 2.1.1
duplicate logging of the input values in the fetch:template action in the Scaffolder meant that some of the secrets were not properly redacted. If $ is not passed through to fetch:template there is no impact. This issue has been resolved in 2.1.1 of the scaffolder-backend plugin. A workaround for this issue involves Template Authors removing the use of $ being used as an argument to fetch:template.

Severity: 2.6 | LOW
