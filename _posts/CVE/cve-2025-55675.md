Description : Apache Superset contains an improper access control vulnerability in its /explore endpoint. A missing authorization check allows an authenticated user to discover metadata about datasources they do not have permission to access. By iterating through the datasource_id in the URL
an attacker can enumerate and confirm the existence and names of protected datasources
leading to sensitive information disclosure.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0
which fixes the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
