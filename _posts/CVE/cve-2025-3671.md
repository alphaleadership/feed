Description : The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to
and including
67.7.0 via the 'page' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to include and execute arbitrary files on the server
allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls
obtain sensitive data
or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various dashboard view files in the plugin. One in particular reported by the researcher can be leveraged to update the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making privilege escalation possible.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
