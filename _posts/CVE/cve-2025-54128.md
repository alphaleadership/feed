Description : HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.7 and below
the NodeJS version of HAX CMS has a disabled Content Security Policy (CSP). This configuration is insecure for a production application because it does not protect against cross-site-scripting attacks. The contentSecurityPolicy value is explicitly disabled in the application's Helmet configuration in app.js. This is fixed in version 11.0.8.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
