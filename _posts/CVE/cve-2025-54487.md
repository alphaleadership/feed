Description : A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8842 of biosig.c on the current master branch (35a819fa)
when the Tag is 12:

                else if (tag==12)    //0x0C
                {
                    // sampling resolution
                    if (len>6) fprintf(stderr
"Warning MFER tag12 incorrect length %i>6\n"
len);
                    val32   = 0;
                    int8_t  v8;
                    curPos += ifread(&UnitCode
1
1
hdr);
                    curPos += ifread(&v8
1
1
hdr);
                    curPos += ifread(buf
1
len-2
hdr);

In addition to values of `len` greater than 130 triggering a buffer overflow
a value of `len` smaller than 2 will also trigger a buffer overflow due to an integer underflow when computing `len-2` in this code path.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
