Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: call rcu_barrier() in ksmbd_server_exit()

racy issue is triggered the bug by racing between closing a connection
and rmmod. In ksmbd
rcu_barrier() is not called at module unload time
so nothing prevents ksmbd from getting unloaded while it still has RCU
callbacks pending. It leads to trigger unintended execution of kernel
code locally and use to defeat protections such as Kernel Lockdown

Severity: 0.0 | NA
