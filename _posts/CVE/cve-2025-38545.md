Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix skb size by accounting for skb_shared_info

While transitioning from netdev_alloc_ip_align() to build_skb()
memory
for the "skb_shared_info" member of an "skb" was not allocated. Fix this
by allocating "PAGE_SIZE" as the skb length
accounting for the packet
length
headroom and tailroom
thereby including the required memory space
for skb_shared_info.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
