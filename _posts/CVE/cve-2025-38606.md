Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid accessing uninitialized arvif->ar during beacon miss

During beacon miss handling
ath12k driver iterates over active virtual
interfaces (vifs) and attempts to access the radio object (ar) via
arvif->deflink->ar.

However
after commit aa80f12f3bed ("wifi: ath12k: defer vdev creation for
MLO")
arvif is linked to a radio only after vdev creation
typically when
a channel is assigned or a scan is requested.
For P2P capable devices
a default P2P interface is created by
wpa_supplicant along with regular station interfaces
these serve as dummy
interfaces for P2P-capable stations
lack an associated netdev and initiate
frequent scans to discover neighbor p2p devices. When a scan is initiated
on such P2P vifs
driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan
frequency
creates a scan vdev
and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the
scan completes or is aborted
the scan vdev is deleted
detaching arvif
from the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.

While handling beacon miss for station interfaces
P2P interface is also
encountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()
tries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.

Fix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing
its ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.
