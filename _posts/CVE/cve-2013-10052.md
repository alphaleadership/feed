Description : ZPanel includes a helper binary named zsudo
intended to allow restricted privilege escalation for administrative tasks. However
when misconfigured in /etc/sudoers
zsudo can be invoked by low-privileged users to execute arbitrary commands as root. This flaw enables local attackers with shell access to escalate privileges by writing a payload to a writable directory and executing it via zsudo. The vulnerability is particularly impactful in post-exploitation scenarios following web server compromise
where the attacker inherits access to zsudo.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
