Description : Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a player. When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive)
the path of the file to write is not checked
potentially leading to zip slips. Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization
so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities
so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 47d188f and shipped in v0.1.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
