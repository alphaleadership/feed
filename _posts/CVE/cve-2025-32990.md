Description : A heap-buffer-overflow (off-by-one) flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in the template parsing logic within the certtool utility. When it reads certain settings from a template file
it allows an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write
resulting in memory corruption and a denial-of-service (DoS) that could potentially crash the system.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
