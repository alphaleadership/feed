Description : Due to an open redirect vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP
an unauthenticated attacker could craft a URL link embedding a malicious script at a location not properly sanitized. When a victim clicks on this link
the script executes within the victim's browser
redirecting them to a site controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to access and/or modify restricted information related to the web client. While the vulnerability poses no impact on data availability
it presents a considerable risk to confidentiality and integrity.

Severity: 6.1 | MEDIUM
