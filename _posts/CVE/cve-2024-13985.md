Description : A command injection vulnerability in Dahua EIMS versions prior to 2240008 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via the capture_handle.action interface. The flaw stems from improper input validation in the captureCommand parameter
which is processed without sanitization or authentication. By sending crafted HTTP requests
attackers can inject OS-level commands that are executed on the server
leading to full system compromise.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL
