Description : The LogIn-SignUp project by VishnuSivadasVS is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsafe construction of SQL queries in DataBase.php. The functions logIn() and signUp() build queries by directly concatenating user input and unvalidated table names without using prepared statements. While a prepareData() function exists
it is insufficient to prevent SQL injection and does not sanitize the table name.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
