Description : A vulnerability exists in riscv-boom SonicBOOM 1.2 (BOOMv1.2) processor implementation
where valid virtual-to-physical address translations configured with write permissions (PTE_W) in SV39 mode may incorrectly trigger a Store/AMO access fault during store instructions (sd). This occurs despite the presence of proper page table entries and valid memory access modes. The fault is reproducible when transitioning into virtual memory and attempting store operations in mapped kernel memory
indicating a potential flaw in the MMU
PMP
or memory access enforcement logic. This may cause unexpected kernel panics or denial of service in systems using BOOMv1.2.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
