Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size
ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2
worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8
worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long)
from sizeof(*f->lt)
lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then
use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally
add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it
replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency
in pipapo_resize().

Severity: 0.0 | NA
