Description : A deserialization vulnerability exists in Volcengine's verl 3.0.0
specifically in the scripts/model_merger.py script when using the "fsdp" backend. The script calls torch.load() with weights_only=False on user-supplied .pt files
allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted model file is loaded. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a victim to download and place a malicious model file in a local directory with a specific filename pattern. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
