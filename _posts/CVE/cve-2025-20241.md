Description : A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated
adjacent attacker to cause the IS-IS process to unexpectedly restart
which could cause an affected device to reload.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the unexpected restart of the IS-IS process
which could cause the affected device to reload
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
Note: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability
an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device.

Severity: 7.4 | HIGH
