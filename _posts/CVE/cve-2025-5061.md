Description : The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'wpie_parse_upload_data' function in all versions up to
and including
3.9.29. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
and permissions granted by an Administrator
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 3.9.29.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
