Description : OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage
store
and distribute sensitive data including secrets
certificates
and keys. In versions 0.1.0 through 2.3.1
when using OpenBao's userpass auth method
user enumeration was possible due to timing difference between non-existent users and users with stored credentials. This is independent of whether the supplied credentials were valid for the given user. This issue was fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around this issue
users may use another auth method or apply rate limiting quotas to limit the number of requests in a period of time: https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW
