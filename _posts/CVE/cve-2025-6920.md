Description : A flaw was found in the authentication enforcement mechanism of a model inference API in ai-inference-server. All /v1/* endpoints are expected to enforce API key validation. However
the POST /invocations endpoint failed to do so
resulting in an authentication bypass. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access the same inference features available on protected endpoints
potentially exposing sensitive functionality or allowing unintended access to backend resources.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
