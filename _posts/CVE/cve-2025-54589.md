Description : Copyparty is a portable file server. In versions 1.18.6 and below
when accessing the recent uploads page at `/?ru`
users can filter the results using an input field at the top. This field appends a filter parameter to the URL
which reflects its value directly into a `` block without proper escaping
allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can be exploited against both authenticated and unauthenticated users. This is fixed in version 1.18.7.

Severity: 6.3 | MEDIUM
