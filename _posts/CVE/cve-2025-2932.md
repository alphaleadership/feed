Description : The JKDEVKIT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'font_upload_handler' function in all versions up to
and including
1.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). If WooCommerce is enabled
attackers will need Contributor-level access and above.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
