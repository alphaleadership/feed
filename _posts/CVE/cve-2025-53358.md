Description : kotaemon is an open-source RAG-based tool for document comprehension. From versions 0.10.6 and prior
in libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/ui.py
the index_fn method accepts both URLs and local file paths without validation. The pipeline streams these paths directly and stores them
enabling attackers to traverse directories (e.g. ../../../../../.env) and exfiltrate sensitive files. This issue has been patched via commit 37cdc28
in version 0.10.7 which has not been made public at time of publication.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
