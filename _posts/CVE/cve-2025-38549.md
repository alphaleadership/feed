Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efivarfs: Fix memory leak of efivarfs_fs_info in fs_context error paths

When processing mount options
efivarfs allocates efivarfs_fs_info (sfi)
early in fs_context initialization. However
sfi is associated with the
superblock and typically freed when the superblock is destroyed. If the
fs_context is released (final put) before fill_super is called—such as
on error paths or during reconfiguration—the sfi structure would leak
as ownership never transfers to the superblock.

Implement the .free callback in efivarfs_context_ops to ensure any
allocated sfi is properly freed if the fs_context is torn down before
fill_super
preventing this memory leak.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
