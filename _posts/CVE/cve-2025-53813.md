allows a local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Nozbe TCC (Transparency
Consent
and Control) permissions. 
Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

This issue was fixed in version 2025.11 of Nozbe.
