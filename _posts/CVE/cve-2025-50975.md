Description : IPFire 2.29 web-based firewall interface (firewall.cgi) fails to sanitize several rule parameters such as PROT
SRC_PORT
TGT_PORT
dnatport
key
ruleremark
src_addr
std_net_tgt
and tgt_addr
allowing an authenticated administrator to inject persistent JavaScript. This stored XSS payload is executed whenever another admin views the firewall rules page
enabling session hijacking
unauthorized actions within the interface
or further internal pivoting. Exploitation requires only high-privilege GUI access
and the complexity of the attack is low.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
