CVE ID : CVE-2025-9190

Description : The configuration of Cursor on macOS
specifically the "RunAsNode" fuse enabled
allows a local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Cursor TCC (Transparency
Consent
and Control) permissions. 
Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Cursor
potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent. 

This issue was detected in 15.4.1 version of Cursor. Project maintainers decided not to fix this issue
because a scenario including a local attacker falls outside their defined threat model.

Severity: 4.8 | MEDIUM
