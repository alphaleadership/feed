Description : GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives
with a certain two-step process. First
the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second
the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file
specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here
the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of "Member name contains '..'" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example
the first archive can contain "x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives
and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which "tar xf" is run more than once (e.g.
when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

Severity: 4.1 | MEDIUM
