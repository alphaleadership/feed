Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Since taprio’s taprio_dev_notifier() isn’t protected by an
RCU read-side critical section
a race with advance_sched()
can lead to a use-after-free.

Adding rcu_read_lock() inside taprio_dev_notifier() prevents this.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
