Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon: fix divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()

The current implementation allows having zero size regions with no special
reasons
but damon_get_intervals_score() gets crashed by divide by zero
when the region size is zero.

  [   29.403950] Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI

This patch fixes the bug
but does not disallow zero size regions to keep
the backward compatibility since disallowing zero size regions might be a
breaking change for some users.

In addition
the same crash can happen when intervals_goal.access_bp is
zero so this should be fixed in stable trees as well.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
