Description : EasyFTP Server versions up to 1.7.0.11 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the FTP command parser. When processing the CWD (Change Working Directory) command
the server fails to properly validate the length of the input string
allowing attackers to overwrite memory on the stack. This flaw enables remote code execution without authentication
as EasyFTP allows anonymous access by default. The vulnerability was resolved in version 1.7.0.12
after which the product was renamed “UplusFtp.”

Severity: 9.3 | CRITICAL
