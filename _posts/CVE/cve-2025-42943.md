Description : SAP GUI for Windows may allow the leak of NTML hashes when specific ABAP frontend services are called with UNC paths. For a successful attack
the attacker needs developer authorization in a specific Application Server ABAP to make changes in the code
and the victim needs to execute by using SAP GUI for Windows. This could trigger automatic NTLM authentication
potentially exposing hashed credentials to an attacker. As a result
it has a high impact on the confidentiality.

Severity: 4.5 | MEDIUM
