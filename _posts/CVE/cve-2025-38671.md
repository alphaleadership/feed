Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: qup: jump out of the loop in case of timeout

Original logic only sets the return value but doesn't jump out of the
loop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. A
malicious or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case and
should be avoided. This is observed during a long time test with a
PCA953x GPIO extender.

Fix it by changing the logic to not only sets the return value
but also
jumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
