Description : Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 1.0.4
it's possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompts to read a file and then send file contents over the network without user confirmation due to an overly broad allowlist of safe commands. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude Code are unaffected
as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to update.

Severity: 7.1 | HIGH
