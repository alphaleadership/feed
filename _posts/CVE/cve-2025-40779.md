Description : If a DHCPv4 client sends a request with some specific options
and Kea fails to find an appropriate subnet for the client
the `kea-dhcp4` process will abort with an assertion failure.  This happens only if the client request is unicast directly to Kea; broadcast messages do not cause the problem.
This issue affects Kea versions 2.7.1 through 2.7.9
3.0.0
and 3.1.0.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
