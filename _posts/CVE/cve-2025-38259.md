Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd9335: Fix missing free of regulator supplies

Driver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path
(wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset())
but does not cleanup
in final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  This
leads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count during
probe errors or unbind.

Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()
which also greatly simplifies the code.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
