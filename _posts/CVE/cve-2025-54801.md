CVE ID : CVE-2025-54801

Description : Fiber is an Express inspired web framework written in Go. In versions 2.52.8 and below
when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g.
test.18446744073704)
the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large
this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion
causing a panic or crash. This is fixed in version 2.52.9.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
