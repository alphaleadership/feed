Description : An issue was discovered in Akamai Ghost
as used for the Akamai CDN platform before 2025-03-26. Under certain circumstances
a client making an HTTP/1.x OPTIONS request with an "Expect: 100-continue" header
and using obsolete line folding
can lead to a discrepancy in how two in-path Akamai servers interpret the request
allowing an attacker to smuggle a second request in the original request body.

Severity: 4.0 | MEDIUM
