CVE ID : CVE-2025-57801

Description : gnark is a zero-knowledge proof system framework. In versions prior to 0.14.0
the Verify function in eddsa.go and ecdsa.go used the S value from a signature without asserting that 0 ≤ S < order
leading to a signature malleability vulnerability. Because gnark’s native EdDSA and ECDSA circuits lack essential constraints
multiple distinct witnesses can satisfy the same public inputs. In protocols where nullifiers or anti-replay checks are derived from R and S
this enables signature malleability and may allow double spending. This issue has been addressed in version 0.14.0.

Severity: 8.6 | HIGH
