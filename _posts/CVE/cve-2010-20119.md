Description : CommuniCrypt Mail versions up to and including 1.16 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its ANSMTP.dll  and AOSMTP.dll  ActiveX controls
specifically within the AddAttachments() method. This method fails to properly validate the length of input strings
allowing data to exceed the bounds of a fixed-size stack buffer. When invoked with an overly long string
the control can corrupt adjacent memory structures
including exception handlers
leading to potential control flow disruption.

Severity: 8.6 | HIGH
