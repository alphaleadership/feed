Description : A remote code execution vulnerability exists within osCommerce Online Merchant version 2.3.4.1 due to insecure default configuration and missing authentication in the installer workflow. By default
the /install/ directory remains accessible after installation. An unauthenticated attacker can invoke install_4.php
submit crafted POST data
and inject arbitrary PHP code into the configure.php file. When the application later includes this file
the injected payload is executed
resulting in full server-side compromise.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
