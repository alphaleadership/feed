Description : In HDP Server versions below 4.6.2.2978 on Linux
unauthorized access could occur via IP spoofing using the X-Forwarded-For header. 

Since XFF is a client-controlled header
it could be spoofed
allowing unauthorized access if the spoofed IP matched a whitelisted range.


This vulnerability could be exploited to bypass IP restrictions
though valid user credentials would still be required for resource access.

Severity: 8.4 | HIGH
