Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()

Sometimes
when a file was read while it was being truncated by
another NFS client
the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
was called twice
and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`
flag.

Most of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation)
nobody
notices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times
which flips `PG_locked` back off:

 1. vfs_read
nfs_read_folio
... nfs_read_add_folio
nfs_return_empty_folio
 2. vfs_read
nfs_read_folio
... netfs_read_collection
netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages
 3. vfs_read
... nfs_do_read_folio
nfs_read_add_folio
nfs_return_empty_folio

The problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the
folio if fscache is enabled
and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is
missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().

Rarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():

Most of the time
however
processes just get stuck forever in
folio_wait_bit_common()
waiting for `PG_locked` to disappear
which
never happens because nobody is really holding the folio lock.
