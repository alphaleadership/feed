Description : Lychee is a free
open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13
a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently
internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation
nor are there any allow-list
timeout
or size restrictions. Because of this
attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw
an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.

Severity: 3.0 | LOW
