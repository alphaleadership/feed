Description : OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage
store
and distribute sensitive data including secrets
certificates
and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below
OpenBao allowed the assignment of policies and MFA attribution based upon entity aliases
chosen by the underlying auth method. When the username_as_alias=true parameter in the LDAP auth method was in use
the caller-supplied username was used verbatim without normalization
allowing an attacker to bypass alias-specific MFA requirements. This issue was fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around this
remove all usage of the username_as_alias=true parameter and update any entity aliases accordingly.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
