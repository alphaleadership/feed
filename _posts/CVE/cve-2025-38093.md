Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add GPU cooling

Unlike the CPU
the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically when it
reaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to
reach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C
endangering the
hardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.

Set up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables
by throttling the GPU speed
when reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
