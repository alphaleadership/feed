Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmci: Prevent the dispatching of uninitialized payloads

The reproducer executes the host's unlocked_ioctl call in two different
tasks. When init_context fails
the struct vmci_event_ctx is not fully
initialized when executing vmci_datagram_dispatch() to send events to all
vm contexts. This affects the datagram taken from the datagram queue of
its context by another task
because the datagram payload is not initialized
according to the size payload_size
which causes the kernel data to leak
to the user space.

Before dispatching the datagram
and before setting the payload content
explicitly set the payload content to 0 to avoid data leakage caused by
incomplete payload initialization.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
