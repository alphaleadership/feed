Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kasan: remove kasan_find_vm_area() to prevent possible deadlock

find_vm_area() couldn't be called in atomic_context.  If find_vm_area() is
called to reports vm area information
kasan can trigger deadlock like:

CPU0                                CPU1
vmalloc();
 alloc_vmap_area();
  spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock)
                                    spin_lock_bh(&some_lock);
   
   
   spin_lock(&some_lock);
                                    
                                    kasan_report();
                                     print_report();
                                      print_address_description();
                                       kasan_find_vm_area();
                                        find_vm_area();
                                         spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock) // deadlock!

To prevent possible deadlock while kasan reports
remove kasan_find_vm_area().
