Description : XWiki through version 17.3.0 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Administration interface
specifically within the HTTP Meta Info field of the Global Preferences Presentation section. An authenticated administrator can inject crafted Apache Velocity template code
which is rendered on the server side without proper validation or sandboxing. This enables the execution of arbitrary template logic
which may expose internal server information or
in specific configurations
lead to further exploitation such as remote code execution or sensitive data leakage. The vulnerability resides in improper handling of dynamic template rendering within user-supplied configuration fields.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
