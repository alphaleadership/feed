Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: das16m1: Fix bit shift out of bounds

When checking for a supported IRQ number
the following test is used:

	/* only irqs 2
3
4
5
6
7
10
11
12
14
and 15 are valid */
	if ((1 options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {

However
`it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace
so
the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by
requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with
the original test.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
