Description : In EMQX before 5.8.6
administrators can install arbitrary novel plugins via the Dashboard web interface. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that this is the intended behavior; however
5.8.6 adds a defense-in-depth feature in which a plugin's acceptability (for later Dashboard installation) is set by the "emqx ctl plugins allow" CLI command.

Severity: 3.0 | LOW
