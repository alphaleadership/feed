Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio-net: fix recursived rtnl_lock() during probe()

The deadlock appears in a stack trace like:

  virtnet_probe()
    rtnl_lock()
    virtio_config_changed_work()
      netdev_notify_peers()
        rtnl_lock()

It happens if the VMM sends a VIRTIO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE request while the
virtio-net driver is still probing.

The config_work in probe() will get scheduled until virtnet_open() enables
the config change notification via virtio_config_driver_enable().

Severity: 0.0 | NA
