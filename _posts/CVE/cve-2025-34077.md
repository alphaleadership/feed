Description : An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the WordPress Pie Register plugin ≤ 3.7.1.4 that allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint. By setting social_site=true and manipulating the user_id_social_site parameter
an attacker can generate a valid WordPress session cookie for any user ID
including administrators. Once authenticated
the attacker may exploit plugin upload functionality to install a malicious plugin containing arbitrary PHP code
resulting in remote code execution on the underlying server.
