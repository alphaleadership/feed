Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: nintendo: avoid bluetooth suspend/resume stalls

Ensure we don't stall or panic the kernel when using bluetooth-connected
controllers. This was reported as an issue on android devices using
kernel 6.6 due to the resume hook which had been added for usb joycons.

First
set a new state value to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_SUSPENDED in a
newly-added nintendo_hid_suspend. This makes sure we will not stall out
the kernel waiting for input reports during led classdev suspend. The
stalls could happen if connectivity is unreliable or lost to the
controller prior to suspend.

Second
since we lose connectivity during suspend
do not try
joycon_init() for bluetooth controllers in the nintendo_hid_resume path.

Tested via multiple suspend/resume flows when using the controller both
in USB and bluetooth modes.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
