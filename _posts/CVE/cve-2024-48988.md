Description : SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache StreamPark.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.6
which fixes the issue.


This vulnerability is present only in the distribution package (SpringBoot platform) and does not involve Maven artifacts.
It can only be exploited after a user has successfully logged into the platform (implying that the attacker would first need to compromise the login authentication). 
As a result
the associated risk is considered relatively low.

Severity: 7.6 | HIGH
