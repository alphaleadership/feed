Description : Vim is an open source
command line text editor. In versions from 9.1.1231 to before 9.1.1400
When processing nested tuples in Vim script
an error during evaluation can trigger a use-after-free in Vim’s internal tuple reference management. Specifically
the tuple_unref() function may access already freed memory due to improper lifetime handling
leading to memory corruption. The exploit requires direct user interaction
as the script must be explicitly executed within Vim. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.1400.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
