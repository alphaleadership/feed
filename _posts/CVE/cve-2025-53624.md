Description : The Docusaurus gists plugin adds a page to your Docusaurus instance
displaying all public gists of a GitHub user. docusaurus-plugin-content-gists versions prior to 4.0.0 are vulnerable to exposing GitHub Personal Access Tokens in production build artifacts when passed through plugin configuration options. The token
intended for build-time API access only
is inadvertently included in client-side JavaScript bundles
making it accessible to anyone who can view the website's source code. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.0.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL
