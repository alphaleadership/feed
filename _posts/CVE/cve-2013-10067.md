Description : Glossword versions 1.8.8 through 1.8.12 contain an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability. When deployed as a standalone application
the administrative interface (gw_admin.php) allows users with administrator privileges to upload files to the gw_temp/a/ directory. Due to insufficient validation of file type and path
attackers can upload and execute PHP payloads
resulting in remote code execution.
