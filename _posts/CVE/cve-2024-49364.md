Description : tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7
a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object
when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed
resulting in k reuse for different messages
leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken
e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
