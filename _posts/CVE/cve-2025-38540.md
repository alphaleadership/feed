the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: quirks: Add quirk for 2 Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras

The Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras (USB ID 04F2:B824 & 04F2:B82C)
report a HID sensor interface that is not actually implemented.
Attempting to access this non-functional sensor via iio_info causes
system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up an unresponsive sensor.

Add these 2 devices to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
