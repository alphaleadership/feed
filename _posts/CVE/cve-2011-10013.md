Description : Traq versions 2.0 through 2.3 contain a remote code execution vulnerability in the admincp/common.php script. The flawed authorization logic fails to halt execution after a failed access check
allowing unauthenticated users to reach admin-only functionality. This can be exploited via plugins.php to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
