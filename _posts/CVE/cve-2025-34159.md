Description : Coolify versions prior to v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability in the application deployment workflow. The platform allows authenticated users
with low-level member privileges
to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation. By crafting a malicious service definition that mounts the host root filesystem
an attacker can gain full root access to the underlying server.
