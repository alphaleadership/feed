Description : n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.0
there is a denial of Service vulnerability in /rest/binary-data endpoint when processing empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://). This allows authenticated attackers to cause service unavailability through malformed filesystem URI requests
effecting the /rest/binary-data endpoint and n8n.cloud instances (confirmed HTTP/2 524 timeout responses). Attackers can exploit this by sending GET requests with empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://) to the /rest/binary-data endpoint
causing resource exhaustion and service disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.0.

Severity: 4.9 | MEDIUM
