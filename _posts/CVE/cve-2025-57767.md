Description : Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to versions 20.15.2
21.10.2
and 22.5.2
if a SIP request is received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn't in a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header
or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response being sent
the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn't being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2
21.10.2
and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
