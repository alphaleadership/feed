Description : flaskBlog is a blog app built with Flask. In 2.8.0 and earlier
the code checks if the userRole is "admin" only when visiting the /admin page
but not when visiting its subroutes. Specifically
only the file routes/adminPanel.py checks the user role when a user is trying to access the admin page
but that control is not done for the pages routes/adminPanelComments.py and routes/adminPanelPosts.py. Thus
an unauthorized user can bypass the intended restrictions
leaking sensitive data and accessing the following pages: /admin/posts
/adminpanel/posts
/admin/comments
and /adminpanel/comments.

Severity: 6.9 | MEDIUM
