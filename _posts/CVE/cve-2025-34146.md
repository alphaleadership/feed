Description : A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in @nyariv/sandboxjs versions <= 0.8.23
allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into Object.prototype via crafted JavaScript code. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or
under certain conditions
escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict code execution. The vulnerability stems from insufficient prototype access checks in the sandbox’s executor logic
particularly in the handling of JavaScript function objects returned.
