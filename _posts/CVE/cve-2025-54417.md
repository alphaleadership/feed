Description : Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. Versions 4.13.8 through 4.16.2 and 5.5.8 through 5.8.3 contain a vulnerability that can bypass CVE-2025-23209: "Craft CMS has a potential RCE with a compromised security key". To exploit this vulnerability
the project must meet these requirements: have a compromised security key and create an arbitrary file in Craft's /storage/backups folder. With those criteria in place
attackers could create a specific
malicious request to the /updater/restore-db endpoint and execute CLI commands remotely. This issue is fixed in versions 4.16.3 and 5.8.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
