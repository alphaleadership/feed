Description : The Uncode Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'uncode_hl_text' and 'uncode_text_icon' shortcodes in all versions up to
and including

to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM
