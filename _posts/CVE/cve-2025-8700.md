Description : Invoice Ninja's configuration on macOS
specifically the presence of entitlement "com.apple.security.get-task-allow"
allows local attackers with unprivileged access (e.g. via a malicious application) to attach a debugger
read or modify the process memory
inject code in the application's context despite being signed with Hardened Runtime and bypass Transparency
Consent
and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

According to Apple documentation
when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement
the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has "get-task-allow" entitlement
the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.


This issue was fixed in version 5.0.175

Severity: 4.8 | MEDIUM
