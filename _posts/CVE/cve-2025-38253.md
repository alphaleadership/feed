Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()

Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended
inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled
as a delayed work (aes_battery_work).

In wacom_remove()
aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently
if
the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending
then hard
crashes or "Oops: general protection fault..." are experienced when
wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g.
this happens with
built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
was still pending at the time of hibernation.

So
take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().

Severity: 0.0 | NA
