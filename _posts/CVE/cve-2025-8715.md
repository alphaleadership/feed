Description : Improper neutralization of newlines in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a user of the origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system account running psql to restore the dump
via psql meta-commands inside a purpose-crafted object name.  The same attacks can achieve SQL injection as a superuser of the restore target server.  pg_dumpall
pg_restore
and pg_upgrade are also affected.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6
16.10
15.14
14.19
and 13.22 are affected.  Versions before 11.20 are unaffected.  CVE-2012-0868 had fixed this class of problem
but version 11.20 reintroduced it.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
