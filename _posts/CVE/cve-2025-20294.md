Description : Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI and web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Manager Software could allow an authenticated
remote attacker with administrative privileges to perform command injection attacks on an affected system and elevate privileges to root.
 
These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation of command arguments supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device with root-level privileges.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
