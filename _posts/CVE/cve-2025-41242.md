Description : Spring Framework MVC applications can be vulnerable to a “Path Traversal Vulnerability” when deployed on a non-compliant Servlet container.

An application can be vulnerable when all the following are true:

  *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded Servlet container
  *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization 
  *  the application  serves static resources https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title  with Spring resource handling


We have verified that applications deployed on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable
as long as default security features are not disabled in the configuration. Because we cannot check exploits against all Servlet containers and configuration variants
we strongly recommend upgrading your application.

Severity: 5.9 | MEDIUM
