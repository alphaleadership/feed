Description : Barracuda products
confirmed in Spam & Virus Firewall
SSL VPN
and Web Application Firewall versions prior to October 2010
contain a path traversal vulnerability in the view_help.cgi endpoint. The locale parameter fails to properly sanitize user input
allowing attackers to inject traversal sequences and null-byte terminators to access arbitrary files on the underlying system. By exploiting this flaw
unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve sensitive configuration files such as /mail/snapshot/config.snapshot
potentially exposing credentials
internal settings
and other critical data.

Severity: 8.7 | HIGH
