Description : The AL Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the check_activate_permission() permission callback for the /wp-json/presslearn/v1/activate REST API endpoint in all versions up to
and including
1.0.2. The callback reads the client-supplied Origin header and
after parsing
allows the request if it matches one of the trusted domains
without ever verifying user authentication
capabilities
or nonce tokens. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate premium features by simply spoofing the Origin header.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
