Description : A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling
a memory structure is freed but not cleared
leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios
posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.

Severity: 4.2 | MEDIUM
