Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "drm/gem-framebuffer: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance"

This reverts commit cce16fcd7446dcff7480cd9d2b6417075ed81065.

The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the
object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space
releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted
in a NULL-pointer deref.

Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 ("drm/gem: Acquire references on
GEM handles for framebuffers") and commit f6bfc9afc751 ("drm/framebuffer:
Acquire internal references on GEM handles") only solved the problem
partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM
framebuffer associated.

Hence
this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.

- cc stable

Severity: 0.0 | NA
