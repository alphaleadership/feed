Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf
ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data() in ktls

When sending plaintext data
we initially calculated the corresponding
ciphertext length. However
if we later reduced the plaintext data length
via socket policy
we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.

This results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data during
ciphertext transmission.

This causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete
"Application Data" packet
leading to errors on the receiving end when
parsing TLS record.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
