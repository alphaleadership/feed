Description : In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3
9.3.5
9.2.7 and 9.1.10
and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.107
9.3.2408.117
and 9.2.2406.121
a low-privileged user that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through the `User Interface - Views` configuration page that could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS).The user could cause the DoS by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability that allows for deletion of arbitrary files within a Splunk directory. The vulnerability requires the low-privileged user to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The low-privileged user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.

Severity: 6.3 | MEDIUM
