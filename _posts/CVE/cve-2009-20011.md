Description : ContentKeeper Web Appliance (now maintained by Impero Software) versions prior to 125.10 are vulnerable to remote command execution due to insecure handling of file uploads via the mimencode CGI utility. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary scripts as the Apache user. Additionally
the exploit can optionally escalate privileges by abusing insecure PATH usage in the benetool binary
resulting in root-level access if successful.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL
