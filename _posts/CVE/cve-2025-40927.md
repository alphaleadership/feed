Description : CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw
This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection
which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.

Although some validation exists
it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values
allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



As a result
an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value
causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body
leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
open redirect or other attacks.

The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

Impact

By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter
an attacker can:

  *  Break the current HTTP header
  *  Inject a new header or entire body
  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
That can lead to the following attacks:

  *  reflected XSS
  *  open redirect
  *  cache poisoning
  *  header manipulation

Severity: 0.0 | NA
