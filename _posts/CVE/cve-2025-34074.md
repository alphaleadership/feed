Description : An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file from an attacker-controlled server
which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks
path restrictions
or execution controls for scheduled task fetches
this feature can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2024-55354.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
