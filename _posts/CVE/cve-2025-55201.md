Description : Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to 9.9.1
a safe template can currently read and write arbitrary files because Copier exposes a few pathlib.Path objects in the Jinja context which have unconstrained I/O methods. This effectively renders the security model w.r.t. filesystem access useless. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.

Severity: 8.5 | HIGH
