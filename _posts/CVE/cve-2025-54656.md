Description : ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Struts.

This issue affects Apache Struts Extras: before 2.

When using LookupDispatchAction
in some cases
Struts may print untrusted input to the logs without any filtering. Specially-crafted input may lead to log output where part of the message masquerades as a separate log line
confusing consumers of the logs (either human or automated). 

As this project is retired
we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
