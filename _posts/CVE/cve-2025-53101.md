Description : ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. In versions prior to 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26
in ImageMagick's `magick mogrify` command
specifying multiple consecutive `%d` format specifiers in a filename template causes internal pointer arithmetic to generate an address below the beginning of the stack buffer
resulting in a stack overflow through `vsnprintf()`. Versions 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26 fix the issue.

Severity: 7.4 | HIGH
