Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)

KASAN reported out of bounds access - cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets().
The code uses mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes) for register value
allocations. But later
this length is set to 8 bytes which causes
test code failures.

As fix
just remove the lenght override
keeping the original value 4
for all operations.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
