Description : The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_associated_files function in all versions up to
and including
3.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
