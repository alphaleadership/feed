Description : ZITADEL is an open source identity management system. Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 4.0.0-rc.2
3.3.2
2.71.13
and 2.70.14
vulnerability in ZITADEL's session management API allows any authenticated user to update a session if they know its ID
due to a missing permission check. This flaw enables session hijacking
allowing an attacker to impersonate another user and access sensitive resources. Versions prior to `2.53.0` are not affected
as they required the session token for updates. Versions 4.0.0-rc.2
3.3.2
2.71.13
and 2.70.14 fix the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
