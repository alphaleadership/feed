Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: Revert "soundwire: qcom: Add set_channel_map api support"

This reverts commit 7796c97df6b1b2206681a07f3c80f6023a6593d5.

This patch broke Dragonboard 845c (sdm845). I see:

    Unexpected kernel BRK exception at EL1

Dan has also reported following issues with the original patch
https://lore.kernel.org/all/33fe8fe7-719a-405a-9ed2-d9f816ce1d57@sabinyo.mountain/

Bug #1:
The zeroeth element of ctrl->pconfig[] is supposed to be unused.  We
start counting at 1.  However this code sets ctrl->pconfig[0].ch_mask = 128.

Bug #2:
There are SLIM_MAX_TX_PORTS (16) elements in tx_ch[] array but only
QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS + 1 (15) in the ctrl->pconfig[] array so it corrupts
memory like Yongqin Liu pointed out.

Bug 3:
Like Jie Gan pointed out
it erases all the tx information with the rx
information.
