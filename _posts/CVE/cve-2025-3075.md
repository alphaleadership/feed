Description : The Elementor Website Builder – More Than Just a Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'elementor-element' shortcode in all versions up to
and including
3.29.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts sites with 'Element Caching' enabled.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM
