Description : The Alobaidi Captcha plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin settings in all versions up to
and including
1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with administrator-level permissions and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Severity: 4.4 | MEDIUM
