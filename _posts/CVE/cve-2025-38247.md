CVE ID : CVE-2025-38247

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)

Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive
it does require
finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()
does not change that.

As the result
we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as
well.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
