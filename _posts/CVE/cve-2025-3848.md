Description : The Download Manager and Payment Form WordPress Plugin – WP SmartPay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 1.1.0 to 2.7.13. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their email through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's email addresses
including administrators
and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
