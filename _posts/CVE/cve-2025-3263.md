Description : A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library
specifically in the `get_configuration_file()` function within the `transformers.configuration_utils` module. The affected version is 4.49.0
and the issue is resolved in version 4.51.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression pattern `config\.(.*)\.json` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings
leading to catastrophic backtracking. This can result in model serving disruption
resource exhaustion
and increased latency in applications using the library.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
