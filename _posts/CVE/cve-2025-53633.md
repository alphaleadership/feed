Description : Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a player. When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive)
the size of the decoded content is not checked
potentially leading to zip bombs decompression. Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization
so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities
so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 14042aa and shipped in v0.1.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
