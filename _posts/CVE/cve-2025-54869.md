Description : FPDI is a collection of PHP classes that facilitate reading pages from existing PDF documents and using them as templates in FPDF. In versions 2.6.2 and below
any application that uses FPDI to process user-supplied PDF files is at risk
causing a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker can upload a small
malicious PDF file that will cause the server-side script to crash due to memory exhaustion. Repeated attacks can lead to sustained service unavailability. This issue is fixed in version 2.6.3.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
