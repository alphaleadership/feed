Description : The Tutor LMS Pro – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘order’ parameter used in the get_submitted_assignments() function in all versions up to
and including
3.7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Tutor-level access and above
to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Only the Pro version is affected.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
