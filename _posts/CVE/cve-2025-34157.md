Description : Coolify versions prior to v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in the project creation workflow. An authenticated user with low privileges can create a project with a maliciously crafted name containing embedded JavaScript. When an administrator attempts to delete the project or its associated resource
the payload executes in the admin’s browser context. This results in full compromise of the Coolify instance
including theft of API tokens
session cookies
and access to WebSocket-based terminal sessions on managed servers.

Severity: 9.4 | CRITICAL
