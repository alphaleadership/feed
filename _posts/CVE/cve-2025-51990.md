Description : XWiki through version 17.3.0 is affected by multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Administration interface
specifically under the Presentation section of the Global Preferences panel. An authenticated administrator can inject arbitrary JavaScript payloads into the HTTP Meta Info
Footer Copyright
and Footer Version fields. These inputs are stored and subsequently rendered without proper output encoding or sanitization on public-facing pages. As a result
the injected scripts are persistently executed in the browser context of any visitor to the affected instances including both authenticated and unauthenticated users. No user interaction is required beyond visiting a page that includes the malicious content. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking
credential theft
unauthorized actions via session riding
or further compromise of the application through client-side attacks. The vulnerability introduces significant risk in any deployment
especially in shared or internet-facing environments where administrator credentials may be compromised.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
