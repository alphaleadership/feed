Description : AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create
deploy
and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents. In v0.6.15 and below
the external API's get_graph_execution_results endpoint has an authorization bypass vulnerability. While it correctly validates user access to the graph_id
it fails to verify ownership of the graph_exec_id parameter
allowing authenticated users to access any execution results by providing arbitrary execution IDs. The internal API implements proper validation for both parameters. This is fixed in v0.6.16.

Severity: 7.7 | HIGH
