Description : FileWrangler <= 5.30 suffers from a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing directory listings from an FTP server. A malicious server can send an overlong folder name in response to a LIST command
triggering memory corruption during client-side rendering. Exploitation requires passive user interaction—simply connecting to the server—without further input. Successful exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution.

Severity: 8.5 | HIGH
