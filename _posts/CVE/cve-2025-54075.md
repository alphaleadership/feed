Description : MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. Prior to version 0.17.2
a remote script-inclusion / stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in @nuxtjs/mdc lets a Markdown author inject a `` element. The `` tag rewrites how all subsequent relative URLs are resolved
so an attacker can make the page load scripts
styles
or images from an external
attacker-controlled origin and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the site’s context. Version 0.17.2 contains a fix for the issue.

Severity: 8.3 | HIGH
