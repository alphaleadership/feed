Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

The handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to
hold the array of `struct comedi_insn`
getting the length from the
`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.
The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too
large.

Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`
value is unreasonable.

Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set
this to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536)
which is the maximum
allowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct
comedi_insn`
and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at
least 1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
