Description : UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel framework. Versions 0.3.0 and prior are vulnerable to CSV injection
also known as formula injection
in the Quick Export feature. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious content into exported CSV files. When the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel
the malicious input may be interpreted as a formula or command
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's device. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution
including the establishment of a reverse shell. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.1 or later.

Severity: 2.5 | LOW
