Description : Sysax Multi Server versions prior to 5.55 contains a stack-based buffer overflow in its SSH service. When a remote attacker supplies an overly long username during authentication
the server copies the input to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking. This allows remote code execution under the context of the service.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
