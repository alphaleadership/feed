Description : LeapFTP < 3.1.x contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its FTP client parser. When the client receives a directory listing containing a filename longer than 528 bytes
the application fails to properly bound-check the input and overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain. This allows an attacker operating a malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine when the file is listed or downloaded.

Severity: 9.3 | CRITICAL
