Description : Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Prior to versions 14.2.32 and 15.4.7
when next() was used without explicitly passing the request object
it could lead to SSRF in self-hosted applications that incorrectly forwarded user-supplied headers. This vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js versions 14.2.32 and 15.4.7. All users implementing custom middleware logic in self-hosted environments are strongly encouraged to upgrade and verify correct usage of the next() function.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
