Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix oops due to non-existence of prealloc backlog struct

If an AF_RXRPC service socket is opened and bound
but calls are
preallocated
then rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() will oops because the
rxrpc_backlog struct doesn't get allocated until the first preallocation is
made.

Fix this by returning NULL from rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() if there is no
backlog struct.  This will cause the incoming call to be aborted.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
