Description : A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0xB2) allows a local attacker to control the RBX register
which is used as an unchecked pointer in the CommandRcx0 function. If the contents at RBX match certain expected values (e.g.
'$DB$' or '2DB$')
the function performs arbitrary writes to System Management RAM (SMRAM)
leading to potential privilege escalation to System Management Mode (SMM) and persistent firmware compromise.

Severity: 8.2 | HIGH
