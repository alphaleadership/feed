Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: libwx: fix the using of Rx buffer DMA

The wx_rx_buffer structure contained two DMA address fields: 'dma' and
'page_dma'. However
only 'page_dma' was actually initialized and used
to program the Rx descriptor. But 'dma' was uninitialized and used in
some paths.

This could lead to undefined behavior
including DMA errors or
use-after-free
if the uninitialized 'dma' was used. Althrough such
error has not yet occurred
it is worth fixing in the code.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
