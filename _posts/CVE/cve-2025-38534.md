Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix copy-to-cache so that it performs collection with ceph+fscache

The netfs copy-to-cache that is used by Ceph with local caching sets up a
new request to write data just read to the cache.  The request is started
and then left to look after itself whilst the app continues.  The request
gets notified by the backing fs upon completion of the async DIO write
but
then tries to wake up the app because NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION isn't
set - but the app isn't waiting there
and so the request just hangs.

Fix this by setting NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION which causes the
notification from the backing filesystem to put the collection onto a work
queue instead.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
