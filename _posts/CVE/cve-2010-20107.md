Description : A stack-based buffer overflow exists in FTP Synchronizer Professional <= v4.0.73.274. When the client connects to an FTP server and issues a LIST command—typically during sync preview or profile creation—the server’s response containing an overly long filename triggers a buffer overflow. This results in the corruption of the Structured Exception Handler (SEH)
potentially allowing remote code execution.

Severity: 8.5 | HIGH
