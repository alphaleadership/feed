Description : Connect2id Nimbus JOSE + JWT before 10.0.2 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a deeply nested JSON object supplied in a JWT claim set
because of uncontrolled recursion. NOTE: this is independent of the Gson 2.11.0 issue because the Connect2id product could have checked the JSON object nesting depth
regardless of what limits (if any) were imposed by Gson.

Severity: 5.8 | MEDIUM
