Description : An Unquoted Search Path vulnerability has been identified in the utility for Moxa’s industrial computers (Windows). Due to the unquoted path configuration in the SerialInterfaceService.exe utility
a local attacker with limited privileges could place a malicious executable in a higher-priority directory within the search path. When the Serial Interface service starts
the malicious executable could be run with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation could allow privilege escalation or enable an attacker to maintain persistence on the affected system. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality
integrity
and availability of the affected device itself
there is no loss of confidentiality
integrity
or availability within any subsequent systems.

Severity: 7.3 | HIGH
