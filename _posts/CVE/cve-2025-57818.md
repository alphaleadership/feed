a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was discovered in Firecrawl's webhook functionality. Authenticated users could configure a webhook to an internal URL and send POST requests with arbitrary headers
which may have allowed access to internal systems. This has been fixed in version 2.0.1. If upgrading is not possible
it is recommend to isolate Firecrawl from any sensitive internal systems.
