and including
1.2.3 via deserialization of untrusted input within the verify_field_val() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin
which is likely to be used alongside
allows attackers to delete arbitrary files
leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.
