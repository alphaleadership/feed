Description : A vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows for arbitrary code execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the module is loaded
it automatically imports test.py
if present in the same directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to write files to the server
allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
