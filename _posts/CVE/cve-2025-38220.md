Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: only dirty folios when data journaling regular files

fstest generic/388 occasionally reproduces a crash that looks as
follows:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference
address: 0000000000000000
...
Call Trace:
 
 ext4_block_zero_page_range+0x30c/0x380 [ext4]

 ...

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio()
but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4
hence the crash.

To avoid this problem
update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path
where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.
