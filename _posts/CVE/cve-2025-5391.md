Description : The WooCommerce Purchase Orders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_file() function in all versions up to
and including
1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
