Description : A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) feature of Cisco IOS Software
IOS XE Software
Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
and Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to trigger a memory leak
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
 This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper processing of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. In the case of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software
a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly. In the case of Cisco ASA and FTD Software
a successful exploit could allow the attacker to partially exhaust system memory
causing system instability such as being unable to establish new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to recover from this condition.

Severity: 8.6 | HIGH
