Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: configfs: Fix OOB read on empty string write

When writing an empty string to either 'qw_sign' or 'landingPage'
sysfs attributes
the store functions attempt to access page[l - 1]
before validating that the length 'l' is greater than zero.

This patch fixes the vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning
of os_desc_qw_sign_store() and webusb_landingPage_store() to handle
the zero-length input case gracefully by returning immediately.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
