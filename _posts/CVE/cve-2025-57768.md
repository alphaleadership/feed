Description : Phproject is a high performance full-featured project management system. From 1.8.0 to before 1.8.3
a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Planned Hours field when creating a new project. When sending a POST request to /issues/new/
the value provided in the Planned Hours field is included in the server response without any HTML encoding or sanitization. Because of this
an attacker can craft a malicious payload such as alert(1) and include it in the planned_hours parameter. The server reflects the input directly in the HTML of the project creation page
causing the browser to interpret and execute it. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.

Severity: 6.9 | MEDIUM
