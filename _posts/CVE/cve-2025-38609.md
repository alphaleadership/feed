Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM / devfreq: Check governor before using governor->name

Commit 96ffcdf239de ("PM / devfreq: Remove redundant governor_name from
struct devfreq") removes governor_name and uses governor->name to replace
it. But devfreq->governor may be NULL and directly using
devfreq->governor->name may cause null pointer exception. Move the check of
governor to before using governor->name.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
