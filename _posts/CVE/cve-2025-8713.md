Description : PostgreSQL optimizer statistics allow a user to read sampled data within a view that the user cannot access.  Separately
statistics allow a user to read sampled data that a row security policy intended to hide.  PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.  Prior to this release
a user could craft a leaky operator that bypassed view access control lists (ACLs) and bypassed row security policies in partitioning or table inheritance hierarchies.  Reachable statistics data notably included histograms and most-common-values lists.  CVE-2017-7484 and CVE-2019-10130 intended to close this class of vulnerability
but this gap remained.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6
16.10
15.14
14.19
and 13.22 are affected.

Severity: 3.1 | LOW
