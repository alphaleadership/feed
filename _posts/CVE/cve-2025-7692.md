Description : The Orion Login with SMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to
and including
1.0.5. This is due to the olws_handle_verify_phone() function not utilizing a strong enough OTP value
exposing the hash needed to generate the OTP value
and no restrictions on the number of attempts to submit the code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users
including administrators
if they have access to their phone number.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH
