Description : LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and its related bits and pieces. In versions 0.5.50 and below
there is a traffic-induced memory leak that can starve the process of memory
leading to loss of visibility. To workaround this issue
set `suricata.yaml app-layer.protocols.http.libhtp.default-config.lzma-enabled` to false. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.51.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH
