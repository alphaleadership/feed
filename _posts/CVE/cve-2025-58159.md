Description : WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.4.11
a remote code execution vulnerability was identified
caused by improper validation of uploaded files. The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames
including those with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate sanitization or extension restrictions
a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded and executed on the server
leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11.

Severity: 9.9 | CRITICAL
