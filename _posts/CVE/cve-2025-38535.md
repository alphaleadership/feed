Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: tegra: xusb: Fix unbalanced regulator disable in UTMI PHY mode

When transitioning from USB_ROLE_DEVICE to USB_ROLE_NONE
the code
assumed that the regulator should be disabled. However
if the regulator
is marked as always-on
regulator_is_enabled() continues to return true
leading to an incorrect attempt to disable a regulator which is not
enabled.

This can result in warnings such as:

[  250.155624] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7326 at drivers/regulator/core.c:3004
_regulator_disable+0xe4/0x1a0
[  250.155652] unbalanced disables for VIN_SYS_5V0

To fix this
we move the regulator control logic into
tegra186_xusb_padctl_id_override() function since it's directly related
to the ID override state. The regulator is now only disabled when the role
transitions from USB_ROLE_HOST to USB_ROLE_NONE
by checking the VBUS_ID
register. This ensures that regulator enable/disable operations are
properly balanced and only occur when actually transitioning to/from host
mode.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
