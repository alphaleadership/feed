Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice

Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access
instruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some
cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions
allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this
but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes
that write to the subdevice
the first `insn->n` data elements are
copied from user-space
but the remaining elements are left
uninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction
handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first
`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction
handlers
filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`
the same data buffer elements are used for
handling a list of instructions
so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`
elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the
subdevice.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
