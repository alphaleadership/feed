Description : A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0x20) allows a local attacker to supply a crafted pointer (FuncBlock) through RBX and RCX register values. This pointer is passed unchecked into multiple flash management functions (ReadFlash
WriteFlash
EraseFlash
and GetFlashInfo) that dereference both the structure and its nested members
such as BufAddr. This enables arbitrary read/write access to System Management RAM (SMRAM)
allowing an attacker to corrupt firmware memory
exfiltrate SMRAM content via flash
or install persistent implants.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
