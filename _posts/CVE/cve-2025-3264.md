Description : A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library
specifically in the `get_imports()` function within `dynamic_module_utils.py`. This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises from a regular expression pattern `\s*try\s*:.*?except.*?:` used to filter out try/except blocks from Python code
which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote code loading disruption
resource exhaustion in model serving
supply chain attack vectors
and development pipeline disruption.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
