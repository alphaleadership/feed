Description : SuiteCRM is an open-source
enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. There is a vulnerability in SuiteCRM version 7.14.6 which allows unauthenticated downloads of any file from the upload-directory
as long as it is named by an ID (e.g. attachments). An unauthenticated attacker could download internal files when he discovers a valid file-ID.
Valid IDs could be brute-forced
but this is quite time-consuming as the file-IDs are usually UUIDs. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.7.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW
