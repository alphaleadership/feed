Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_mode

Andrei Lalaev reported a NULL pointer deref when a CAN device is
restarted from Bus Off and the driver does not implement the struct
can_priv::do_set_mode callback.

There are 2 code path that call struct can_priv::do_set_mode:
- directly by a manual restart from the user space
via
  can_changelink()
- delayed automatic restart after bus off (deactivated by default)

To prevent the NULL pointer deference
refuse a manual restart or
configure the automatic restart delay in can_changelink() and report
the error via extack to user space.

As an additional safety measure let can_restart() return an error if
can_priv::do_set_mode is not set instead of dereferencing it
unchecked.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
