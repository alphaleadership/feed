Description : SAP Fiori (Launchpad) is vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability due to inadequate external navigation protections for its link () elements. An attacker with administrative user privileges could exploit this by leveraging compromised or malicious pages. While administrative access is necessary for certain configurations
the attacker does not need the administrative privileges to execute the attack. This could result in unintended manipulation of user sessions or exposure of sensitive information. The issue impacts the confidentiality and integrity of the system
but the availability remains unaffected.

Severity: 3.5 | LOW
