Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: clip: Fix memory leak of struct clip_vcc.

ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) allocates struct clip_vcc and set it to
vcc->user_back.

The code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skb
to vcc->push() when the socket is close()d
and then clip_push()
frees clip_vcc.

However
ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL) sets NULL to vcc->push() in
atm_init_atmarp()
resulting in memory leak.

Let's serialise two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push()
in atm_init_atmarp() to prevent memleak.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
