Description : The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Import in all versions up to
and including
7.97 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with administrator-level access
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Severity: 4.4 | MEDIUM
