Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths

VHT operating mode notifications are not defined for channel widths
below 20 MHz. In particular
5 MHz and 10 MHz are not valid under the
VHT specification and must be rejected.

Without this check
malformed notifications using these widths may
reach ieee80211_chan_width_to_rx_bw()
leading to a WARN_ON due to
invalid input. This issue was reported by syzbot.

Reject these unsupported widths early in sta_link_apply_parameters()
when opmode_notif is used. The accepted set includes 20
40
80
160
and 80+80 MHz
which are valid for VHT. While 320 MHz is not defined
for VHT
it is allowed to avoid rejecting HE or EHT clients that may
still send a VHT opmode notification.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
