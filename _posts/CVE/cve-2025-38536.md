Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: airoha: fix potential use-after-free in airoha_npu_get()

np->name was being used after calling of_node_put(np)
which
releases the node and can lead to a use-after-free bug.
Previously
of_node_put(np) was called unconditionally after
of_find_device_by_node(np)
which could result in a use-after-free if
pdev is NULL.

This patch moves of_node_put(np) after the error check to ensure
the node is only released after both the error and success cases
are handled appropriately
preventing potential resource issues.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
