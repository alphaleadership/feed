Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: accel: fxls8962af: Fix use after free in fxls8962af_fifo_flush

fxls8962af_fifo_flush() uses indio_dev->active_scan_mask (with
iio_for_each_active_channel()) without making sure the indio_dev
stays in buffer mode.
There is a race if indio_dev exits buffer mode in the middle of the
interrupt that flushes the fifo. Fix this by calling
synchronize_irq() to ensure that no interrupt is currently running when
disabling buffer mode.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000 when read
