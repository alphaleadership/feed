Description : VMware ESXi
Workstation
and Fusion contain a heap-overflow vulnerability in the PVSCSI (Paravirtualized SCSI) controller that leads to an out of-bounds write. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi
the exploitation is contained within the VMX sandbox and exploitable only with configurations that are unsupported. On Workstation and Fusion
this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.
