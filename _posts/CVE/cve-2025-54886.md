Description : skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below
the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models
it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation
raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However
when non-.zip file formats are provided
the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops
joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading
bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.

Severity: 8.4 | HIGH
