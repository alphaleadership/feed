Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix yet another UAF in binder_devices

Commit e77aff5528a18 ("binderfs: fix use-after-free in binder_devices")
addressed a use-after-free where devices could be released without first
being removed from the binder_devices list. However
there is a similar
path in binder_free_proc() that was missed:
