Description : ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2
passing a geometry string containing only a colon (":") to montage -geometry leads GetGeometry() to set width/height to 0. Later
ThumbnailImage() divides by these zero dimensions
triggering a crash (SIGFPE/abort)
resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW
