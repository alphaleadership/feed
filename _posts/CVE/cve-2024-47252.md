Description : Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.

In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI
no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
