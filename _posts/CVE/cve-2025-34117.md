Description : A remote code execution vulnerability exists in multiple Netcore and Netis routers models with firmware released prior to August 2014 due to the presence of an undocumented backdoor listener on UDP port 53413. Exact version boundaries remain undocumented. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP packets to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This backdoor uses a hardcoded authentication mechanism and accepts shell commands post-authentication. Some device models include a non-standard implementation of the `echo` command
which may affect exploitability.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
