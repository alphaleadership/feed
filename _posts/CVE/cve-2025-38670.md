Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/entry: Mask DAIF in cpu_switch_to()
call_on_irq_stack()

`cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()` manipulate SP to change
to different stacks along with the Shadow Call Stack if it is enabled.
Those two stack changes cannot be done atomically and both functions
can be interrupted by SErrors or Debug Exceptions which
though unlikely
is very much broken : if interrupted
we can end up with mismatched stacks
and Shadow Call Stack leading to clobbered stacks.

In `cpu_switch_to()`
it can happen when SP_EL0 points to the new task
but x18 stills points to the old task's SCS. When the interrupt handler
tries to save the task's SCS pointer
it will save the old task
SCS pointer (x18) into the new task struct (pointed to by SP_EL0)
clobbering it.

In `call_on_irq_stack()`
it can happen when switching from the task stack
to the IRQ stack and when switching back. In both cases
we can be
interrupted when the SCS pointer points to the IRQ SCS
but SP points to
the task stack. The nested interrupt handler pushes its return addresses
on the IRQ SCS. It then detects that SP points to the task stack
calls `call_on_irq_stack()` and clobbers the task SCS pointer with
the IRQ SCS pointer
which it will also use !

This leads to tasks returning to addresses on the wrong SCS
or even on the IRQ SCS
triggering kernel panics via CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
or FPAC if enabled.

This is possible on a default config
but unlikely.
However
when enabling CONFIG_ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI
DAIF is unmasked and
instead the GIC is responsible for filtering what interrupts the CPU
should receive based on priority.
Given the goal of emulating NMIs
pseudo-NMIs can be received by the CPU
even in `cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()`
possibly *very*
frequently depending on the system configuration and workload
leading
to unpredictable kernel panics.

Completely mask DAIF in `cpu_switch_to()` and restore it when returning.
Do the same in `call_on_irq_stack()`
but restore and mask around
the branch.
Mask DAIF even if CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK is not enabled for consistency
of behaviour between all configurations.

Introduce and use an assembly macro for saving and masking DAIF
as the existing one saves but only masks IF.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
