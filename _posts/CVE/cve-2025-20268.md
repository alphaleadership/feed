Description : A vulnerability in the Geolocation-Based Remote Access (RA) VPN feature of Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to bypass configured policies to allow or deny HTTP connections based on a country or region.

This vulnerability exists because the URL string is not fully parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP connection through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured policies and gain access to a network where the connection should have been denied.

Severity: 5.8 | MEDIUM
