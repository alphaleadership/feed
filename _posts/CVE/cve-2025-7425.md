Description : A flaw was found in libxslt where the attribute type
atype
flags are modified in a way that corrupts internal memory management. When XSLT functions
such as the key() process
result in tree fragments
this corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result
the system may access freed memory
causing crashes or enabling attackers to trigger heap corruption.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH
