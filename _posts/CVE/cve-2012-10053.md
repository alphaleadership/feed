Description : Simple Web Server 2.2 rc2 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its handling of the Connection HTTP header. When a remote attacker sends an overly long string in this header
the server uses vsprintf() without proper bounds checking
leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process. The vulnerability is triggered before authentication.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
