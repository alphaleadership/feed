Description : Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. In versions below 0.2.111
a path validation flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical path comparison
makes it possible to bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the CWD. Successful exploitation depends on the presence of (or ability to create) a directory with the same prefix as the CWD and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This is fixed in version 0.2.111.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
