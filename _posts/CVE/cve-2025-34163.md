Description : Dongsheng Logistics Software exposes an unauthenticated endpoint at /CommMng/Print/UploadMailFile that fails to enforce proper file type validation and access control. An attacker can upload arbitrary files
including executable scripts such as .ashx
via a crafted multipart/form-data POST request. This allows remote code execution on the server
potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to July 2025 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product
though the exact affected range remains undefined.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL
