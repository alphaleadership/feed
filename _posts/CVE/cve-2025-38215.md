Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode
it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var()
as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there
i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

================================================================

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails
it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.
