Description : File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload
delete
preview
rename
and edit files. In version 2.38.0
a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file processing logic when reading a file on endpoint  `Filebrowser-Server-IP:PORT/files/{file-name}` . While the server correctly handles and stores uploaded files
it attempts to load the entire content into memory during read operations without size checks or resource limits. This allows an authenticated user to upload a large file and trigger uncontrolled memory consumption on read
potentially crashing the server and making it unresponsive. As of time of publication
no known patches are available.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
