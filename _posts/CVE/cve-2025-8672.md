Description : MacOS version of GIMP bundles a Python interpreter that inherits the Transparency
Consent
and Control (TCC) permissions
granted by the user to the main application bundle. An attacker with local user access can
invoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts
leveraging the
application's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of GIMP
potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent.

This issue has been fixed in 3.1.4.2 version of GIMP.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
