Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller
courtesy of syzbot
identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver
caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 ("net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors").

For instance
usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes
even if the caller expected the full amount
and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows
this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.
