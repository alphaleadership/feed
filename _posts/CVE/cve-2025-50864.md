Description : An Origin Validation Error in the elysia-cors library thru 1.3.0 allows attackers to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. The library incorrectly validates the supplied origin by checking if it is a substring of any domain in the site's CORS policy
rather than performing an exact match. For example
a malicious origin like "notexample.com"
"example.common.net" is whitelisted when the site's CORS policy specifies "example.com." This vulnerability enables unauthorized access to user data on sites using the elysia-cors library for CORS validation.
