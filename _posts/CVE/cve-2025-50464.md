Description : A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the upload.cgi module of the iptime NAS firmware v1.5.04. The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8
allocated 8 bytes) without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed
the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
