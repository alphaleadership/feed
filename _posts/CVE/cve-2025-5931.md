Description : The Dokan Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
4.0.5. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password during a staff password reset. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with vendor-level access and above
to elevate their privilege to the level of a staff member and then change arbitrary user passwords
including those of administrators in order to gain access to their accounts. By default
the plugin allows customers to become vendors.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
