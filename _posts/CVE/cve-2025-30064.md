Description : An insufficiently secured internal function allows session generation for arbitrary users. The decodeParam function checks the JWT but does not verify which signing algorithm was used. As a result
an attacker can use the "ex:action" parameter in the VerifyUserByThrustedService function to generate a session for any user.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH
