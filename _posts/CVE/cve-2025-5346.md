Description : Bluebird devices contain a pre-loaded barcode scanner application. This application exposes an unsecured broadcast receiver "kr.co.bluebird.android.bbsettings.BootReceiver". A local attacker can call the receiver to overwrite file containing ".json" keyword with default barcode config file. It is possible to overwrite file in any location due to lack of protection against path traversal in name of the file.

This issue affects all versions before 1.3.3.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
