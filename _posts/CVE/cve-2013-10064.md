Description : A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in ActFax Server version 5.01. The server's RAW protocol interface fails to safely process user-supplied data in @F506 fax header fields due to insecure usage of strcpy. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted @F506 fields
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation requires network access to TCP port 4559 and does not require authentication.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
