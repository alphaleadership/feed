Description : An incorrect encryption implementation vulnerability exists in the system log dump feature of BYD's DiLink 3.0 OS (e.g. in the model ATTO3). An attacker with physical access to the vehicle can bypass the encryption of log dumps on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) unit's storage. This allows the attacker to access and read system logs containing sensitive data
including personally identifiable information (PII) and location data.

This vulnerability was introduced in a patch intended to fix CVE-2024-54728.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
