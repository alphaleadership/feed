Description : Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions before 12.16.0.RELEASE
and from 13.0.0.RELEASE to before 13.1.2.RELEASE
any admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources. This includes but is not limited to: running executables on the application host
inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties
spring beans (application context
database pooling). The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: the user must be logged in
have the admin role
and must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine. Version 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade. If no scripting is needed in any of the processes
it could be possible to disable it altogether via the ProcessEngineConfiguration. However
this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL
