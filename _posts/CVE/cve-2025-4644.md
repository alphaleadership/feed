Description : A Session Fixation vulnerability existed in Payload's SQLite adapter due to identifier reuse during account creation. A malicious attacker could create a new account
save its JSON Web Token (JWT)
and then delete the account
which did not invalidate the JWT. As a result
the next newly created user would receive the same identifier
allowing the attacker to reuse the JWT to authenticate and perform actions as that user.

This issue has been fixed in version 3.44.0 of Payload.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM
