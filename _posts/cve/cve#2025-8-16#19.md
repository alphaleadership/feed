Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix bug due to prealloc collision

When userspace is using AF_RXRPC to provide a server
it has to preallocate
incoming calls and assign to them call IDs that will be used to thread
related recvmsg() and sendmsg() together.  The preallocated call IDs will
automatically be attached to calls as they come in until the pool is empty.

To the kernel
the call IDs are just arbitrary numbers
but userspace can
use the call ID to hold a pointer to prepared structs.  In any case
the
user isn't permitted to create two calls with the same call ID (call IDs
become available again when the call ends) and EBADSLT should result from
sendmsg() if an attempt is made to preallocate a call with an in-use call
ID.

However
the cleanup in the error handling will trigger both assertions in
rxrpc_cleanup_call() because the call isn't marked complete and isn't
marked as having been released.

Fix this by setting the call state in rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() and then
marking it as being released before calling the cleanup function.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
