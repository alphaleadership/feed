Description : Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to version 3.18.5
it is possible to craft a JSON Schema file in a manner which could cause Helm to use all available memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination. This issue has been resolved in Helm 3.18.5. A workaround involves ensuring all Helm charts that are being loaded into Helm do not have any reference of $ref pointing to /dev/zero.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM
