CVE ID : CVE-2025-38537 Published : Aug. 16

48 minutes ago Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy If a PHY has no driver
the genphy driver is probed/removed directly in phy_attach/detach. If the PHY's ofnode has an "leds" subnode
then the LEDs will be (un)registered when probing/removing the genphy driver. This could occur if the leds are for a non-generic driver that isn't loaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in phy_detach leads to the following deadlock: rtnl_lock() ndo_close() ... phy_detach() phy_remove() phy_leds_unregister() led_classdev_unregister() led_trigger_set() netdev_trigger_deactivate() unregister_netdevice_notifier() rtnl_lock() There is a corresponding deadlock on the open/register side of things (and that one is reported by lockdep)
but it requires a race while this one is deterministic. Generic PHYs do not support LEDs anyway
so don't bother registering them. Severity: 0.0 | NA Visit the link for more details
