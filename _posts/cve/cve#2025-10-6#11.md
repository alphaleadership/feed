Description : ssh in OpenSSH before 10.1 allows control characters in usernames that originate from certain possibly untrusted sources
potentially leading to code execution when a ProxyCommand is used. The untrusted sources are the command line and %-sequence expansion of a configuration file. (A configuration file that provides a complete literal username is not categorized as an untrusted source.)

Severity: 3.6 | LOW
