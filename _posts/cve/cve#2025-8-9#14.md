Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Resolve TX timeout error in power save stress test

This fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on
btnxpuart for couple of hours
such that the interval between two HCI
commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.

Test procedure using bash script:

hciconfig hci0 up
//Enable Power Save feature
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00
while (true)
do
    hciconfig hci0 leadv
    sleep 2
    hciconfig hci0 noleadv
    sleep 2
done

Error log
after adding few more debug prints:
Bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0A 20 01 00
Bluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on
status=0
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00
Can't set advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110)
Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout

When the power save mechanism turns on UART break
and btnxpuart_tx_work()
is scheduled simultaneously
psdata->ps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE
which prevents the psdata->work from being scheduled
which is responsible
to turn OFF UART break.

This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as
well as around ps_state read/write.
btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is
PS_STATE_SLEEP
it will first schedule psdata->work
and then it will
reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is
PS_STATE_AWAKE.

Tested above script for 50
000 iterations and TX timeout error was not
observed anymore.

Severity: 0.0 | NA
