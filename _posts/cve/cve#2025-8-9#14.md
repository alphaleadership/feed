work from being scheduled
which is responsible to turn OFF UART break. This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as well as around ps_state read/write. btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is PS_STATE_SLEEP
it will first schedule psdata->work
and then it will reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is PS_STATE_AWAKE. Tested above script for 50
000 iterations and TX timeout error was not observed anymore. Severity: 0.0 | NA Visit the link for more details
